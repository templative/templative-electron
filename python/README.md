# Templative

[Watch the explanation video!](https://youtu.be/cfaSQqnhyrE)

Templative allows you to assemble board games using json and svgs. To create a complete board game run the following commands:

- `templative init`
- `templative create deck poker --name potionDeck`
- `templative produce`
- `templative upload`
- `templative playground`
- `templative printout frontback`

Now you have a board game complete with a rules document, a potion deck, a package in Tabletop Playground, a listing on the GameCrafter ready for purchase, and a pdf ready for print-and-play. It's that powerful.

Use `templative --help` for more info.

# Usage

## Create a Project
- Create and cd into a directory
- `templative init`
- `templative produce` to create a version of the game in the output folder. 
- Create `./output` folder.

## Creating Components

Create a new component in your game using the following command:

`templative create TYPE --name NAME`

Replace `TYPE` with the type of the component you'd like, and replace `NAME` with the name of your new component.

To see which component types Templative supports, run the following command (the following output may be outdated):

```
templative create

  Create components from templates

Commands:
  accordion  Create a new Accordion
  deck       Create a new Decks
  die        Create a new Die
  packaging  Create Packaging
  punchout   Create a new Punchout
```

Each component is defined in `component-compose.json`, and has a pieces csv/json file, a component json file, artdata files, template svgs, and overlaid svgs.

### Defining Gamedata

Gamedata files are csv and json files that contain data for each piece of each component. All gamedata files must include the `name`, `displayName`, `quantity`.

### Artfiles

Art files must have a `viewbox` that matches the gamecrafter specifications. For instance if poker cards require 825px by 1125px then the viewbox must be `0 0 825 1125` and the document size must specify px with width at `825px` and height at `1125px`. Viewbox inherits the units of the width and height.

Add the cmyk color profile in the Document Setup of Inkscape. This adds the following color file to the `<defs>` tag:
```
<color-profile
  name="Generic-CMYK-Profile"
  xlink:href="file:///System/Library/ColorSync/Profiles/Generic%20CMYK%20Profile.icc"
  id="color-profile161" />
</defs>
```

# Using ArtData

ArtData files are json files that contain instructions for how to assemble a piece jpg using art files and metadata.

Each piece begins as a copy of the template file defined in the `templateFilename` field of the artData file. For instance, a `templateFilename` of `action` would copy `art/templates/action.svg`.

An art metadata file can perform three types of commands: *text replacements*, *style updates*, and *overlays*.

What data Templative uses to perform the command depends on the scope of the command. Each command takes in data from the following supported scopes: `piece` from piece gamedata, `component` from component gamedata, `game` from `game.json`, `studio` from `studio.json`, `global` for literals. See examples of how data is used by each command type below.

## Text Replacements Commands

Text replacements find instances of the `{key}` and replace it with a sourced value.

Consider the following text replacements:

```
  "textReplacements": [
    { "scope": "game", "source": "displayName", "key": "gameName" },
    { "scope": "piece", "source": "points", "key": "power",  }
  ]
```

The first text replacement command replaces all instances of the text `{gameName}` in the template svg with the value of the `displayName` field in the `game.json` file.

The second text replacement replaces all instances of `{power}` with the `points` field of the current piece.

## Overlays

Overlays are svgs that we overlay on top of the copied svg template. Consider the two overlay commands below:

```
  "overlays": [
    { "scope": "piece", "source": "graphic" },
    { "scope": "global", "source": "versionQuantity" }
  ]
```

The first overlay looks in the `piece` gamedata file for a field called `graphic`. As an example, a piece's `graphic` field is `bossMonsterA`. This instructs Templative to overlay the svg `graphicalInserts/bossMonsterA.svg` on top of the template. 

The second overlay looks for `graphicalInserts/versionQuantity.svg`, as global implies a literal, non-lookup value.

Overlay commands are the first commands to occur. 

### Overlays

Overlays are svgs found in the `art/graphicalInserts` folder.

Overlays must be the same size as the template it is overlaying. For instance, both the poker card template svg and the overlay svg must be `825x1125px`. Overlay svg documents are placed at the top left corner of your base svg document. This should place it correctly in your image if they are both the same size. 

## Style Updates

Style updates allow you to update a style attribute of a svg element at a given id. Consider the following style update:

```
  "styleUpdates":[
    { 
      "id": "background", 
      "cssValue": "fill", 
      "scope": "piece", 
      "source": "colorRGB" 
    }
  ]
```

This command looks for the xml element with the id `background` within the svg and replaces it's `fill` css value with the piece's `colorRGB` value.

Any valid css value for svgs is valid here.


## Uploading to the GameCrafter

Upload your last `templative produce`'d game using the following steps.

- Create an account on the [Game Crafter](https://www.thegamecrafter.com)
- Get an [api key](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/account/apikeys) from the Game Crafter
- Add the `THEGAMECRAFTER_PUBLIC_KEY`, `THEGAMECRAFTER_USERNAME`, and `THEGAMECRAFTER_PASSWORD` to your [user env vars](https://www.schrodinger.com/kb/1842).
- Update `studio.json` with your designer id from the gamecrafter.
- `templative upload` to upload the last produced version to the Game Crafter.
- Visit the url generated at the end of uploading.

## Generating a Tabletop Playground Package

Create a Tabletop Playground package of your last `templative produce`'d game using the following command. 

`templative playground --output PACKAGESDIRECTORY`

Replace `PACKAGESDIRECTORY` with your own Tabletop Playground directory.

From the [Tabletop Playground wiki](https://tabletop-playground.com/knowledge-base/packages/), the packages directories are:
- Mac: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Epic/TabletopPlayground` (Note the `\ `)
- Linux: `~/.config/Epic/TabletopPlayground/Packages`
- Windows: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\TabletopPlayground\TabletopPlayground\PersistentDownloadDir`

## Create a Letter Printout (Experimental)

Create a print out your last `templative produce`'d game using `templative printout front` or `templative printout frontback`.

Front back includes back images on the back page. Components are grouped together to make cutting easy. The sizing and dpi of cards is in test at the moment. Please help out by submitting issues.

## Using newlines in gamedata

Newlines only work when the text area used is flowed into a frame.
