Accumulation
Some things in your game accumulate — they stay or grow. Others are cyclical — they come and go.

Component accumulation
Ideally, things in your game should grow or amass.

Having scores that grow during the game is a kind of accumulation. A useful mental exercise is the following:

Take a look at your game (or any game).

Ignore the rules and scores for a second. Where are the physical components going?

If you have a hand of cards, where are they going? What about resources, and other objects? Are they being discarded, or are they amassing in front of you?

If your components aren't amassing, they probably should be.

In my farm game, planting apple trees felt good. You plant them once, and they give you food for the rest of the game. Pine trees were planted once, and then you'd later cut them down for wood. That felt bad, as nothing long-term was gained. I changed the pine trees, so that you now cut them back to a stump, that never stops growing back.

You need a ramp
Accumulation does all kinds of good things for your game. Ramps also tie the turns together, making for great long-term strategy.

The feeling of progress is a very strong enjoyment factor.

It's quite okay to have cyclical resources or money. However, they should be spent on something that provides permanent benefit.

In Splendor, players take three gem tokens per turn, or they spend gem tokens, to buy cards. These cards provide points, but they also provide a discount on all future purchases. The gems are a cyclical resource — they constantly leave the player, while the bought cards accumulate.

Cyclical play
As I'm growing tired of crap euro games, I'm increasingly looking at the game being played, or at the back of the box. If each player doesn't have their own board or tableau, the game is probably cyclical and terrible, and I don't want to play it. 

I like Agricola, so I made my own farming game. You ran a farm, and periodically, "guests" would come along. You could feed them, and provide housing, clothes, or a fire, to keep them warm. This was how you got points. This was open-ended, so you could satisfy the guests on any scale you liked. Players would often kill off all their animals, or create a great bonfire, rather than build things like buildings or fences. This degree of freedom was great, but after cashing in half their farm, a player was left rather deflated and aimless. They were basically back at the start of the game. What would they do now?

Allowing players to make the game highly cyclical was a huge mistake. They shouldn't have been able to neglect and undo their accumulation to that degree. I didn't understand this mistake at the time, and it killed the game.

Adversarial games
Cyclical play is a huge trap that adversarial games fall into, as attacking the enemy is typically cyclical, not accumulative.

Radlands has no accumulation. It gets lots of fun from other sources, but the absence of a ramp made it much harder to design.

I've played numerous "battle" game prototypes, where the player plays a variety of cards, in order to fight enemies on the board. I get the cards, I play them, and the enemy is defeated. It's nice that I'm closer to victory, or have gained some points, but I still feel exactly the same as I did before. I'm not any stronger. I want to be rewarded with an upgraded gun or something.

In 7 Wonders, each card taken is either a resource or prerequisite, that stays for the rest of the game, and pays for future things. 

Resources, systems, victory
In a bad game, a player takes resources, and spends those resources to achieve victory.

In a good, accumulative game, a player gains resources, spends those resources to create systems, and those systems create victory. (The systems might just create more resources, which create victory. That's fine, too.)

I want to build an orchard, not just be a fruit-picker.

Systems are fun. Victory is not. Victory should just be the natural result of the successful creation of systems.

Awesome Things
Designers often focus so much on fairness and balance that they forget about the great entertainment value of doing something outrageous.

In Radlands, there are people and effects that cost all your water (the game's resource) for one turn, and have huge effects that almost break the game.

Break the rules
Most of your cards (or other objects) should be simple and straightforward. However, you should also include a few things in your game that break fundamental rules of your game, or seem too amazingly-good to be possible. When someone sees this thing, they should say ""WHAAA?!?!?!"" and immediately imagine the possibilities it opens up. Everything that doesn't just say "I win" should probably be considered for inclusion in your game somewhere.

These things should feel awesome but actually be entirely reasonable.

In Radlands, your location cards are the base for your game. They provide handy abilities that help your own people, or hurt the opponent's. The card "Reactor" blows up and kills all people in play. The card "Juggernaut" is a wheeled city that literally moves across the table, towards the opponent.
In my gangster game, locations let you roll various dice, which have effects on them. The "Corrupt Mayor" location lets you roll seven of the red die — a ridiculous number that's likely to eliminate all the other players. It's suitably expensive to do this, of course.

In Magic, there are "Planeswalker" cards. These are characters of exceptional power, who join you. Typically, each has three different abilities, and the last one is an "ultimate" ability. It might be the case that one of the other abilities is technically better value, but the ultimate ability is something big. Create five dragons, or remove almost all of the opponent's deck from the game, or gain 100 life (you start with 20.)

A good game is enjoyed while you play it. A great game creates an experience you'll remember, and a story you'll want to tell others.

daniel.games
Balance
Balance is when game parts or choices are similar in value.

Yes, Balance is Good
Balance is generally desirable, as it means each option is viable, giving the player real choice. It also means the game is probably fairer, and there are no parts of the game that no one ever uses.

Don't worry about it
Balance is not that important.

Plenty of other things are more important.

Balance is also very easy to achieve. Almost anything can be balanced, which means that you can really do whatever you like, and just balance it all later.

Balance is not the same thing as fun. Do not excuse un-funness for balance reasons.

Chess is still a great game, even though white wins more than black. It's even less important that rooks are better than knights.

I know some cards I make are imbalanced (too strong, or too weak.) That's fine. It just happened that the simple, clean version of the card was imbalanced.

Choose elegance over balance.

As long as the card has some value, and isn't "feelbad" for anyone, I'm happy with it.

The other thing about cards is that a player has many of them. Some will be imbalanced individually, but a hand is likely to be balanced overall.

I do try to make all options balanced, but each option need only be balanced enough to be worthy of consideration by the player. If there are two options, and one is chosen only 25% of the time, that's still fine. 

HOw do I Know What's Balanced?
Someone recently asked me how I balanced Radlands. The real answer is that when balancing something, I just guess, and then play the game. If something is too strong, I make it weaker. If it's too weak, I make it stronger.

If I want something a bit more precise, I'll try to balance something by comparing it to something similar.

If you really want to balance, try to convert everything into your game's "lowest common denominator" resource, so you can roughly compare things.

Don't try to do mathematical calculations beyond that. I've been guilty of trying to balance things with a spreadsheet. It might seem doable, but what's the value of something that's slow, or the value of something that's overkill? There cannot be an absolute system for balance.

Considerations for Balance
Be aware that something might actually be costing a second resource you're not aware of.

One action might cost twice as much as another, and give twice as much reward. However, both actions consume the player's turn, thereby making the bigger action better.

Some cards, in particular, are fair with a cost of zero, because they still cost a card.

A common mistake is to forget to compare the alternative. If there's a space where I can get two gold, and a space where I can spend three gold on a valuable item, what should the item's real value to the player be (if you had to convert it to gold)? Assume that gold and items are both good to have.

If you chose three, that's not balanced. Buying the item loses you three gold and gains you three, for a net gain of zero. The gold space gains you positive two gold. The item should in fact be worth five gold.

Balance with numbers
When you actually want to rebalance something, take note of the following:

A good designer balances by changing numbers. A bad designer adds rules text.

Make sure your cards (or other components) have a number on them. It could be a cost. It could be a points value. This allows easy fine-tuning of balance.

In Radlands, each player starts with three camp cards. These are important. When I started designing these camps, I knew balancing them would be difficult, so I added a numerical component. Every camp card has a number in its corner, and each player draws a starting hand equal to the total of these numbers on their camps. This way, weaker camps can be balanced by having a higher number, and vice versa.

Just make the simplest and nicest version of each object, and then balance it by tweaking its numbers.

Intentional imbalance
Sometimes, you want to imbalance things.

In deck-builder game Dominion, you start the game with a deck of ten bad cards. You add good cards to it, and try to remove the bad ones. The Chapel card can remove four cards from the deck in one turn. This card is amazingly good, but the designer knew that. The idea is that a game with Chapel in it will be distinctly different from other games.

I like to imbalance things that are necessary for the game to progress, or otherwise remain healthy. Every option should be worthy of consideration, but I make these options have a clear edge over the others.

In an earlier version of my gangster game, location cards would come and go throughout the game. I wanted the board to keep changing. I could've said "every turn, or round, draw a new location card." However, I didn't want any kind of turn structure, where players had to remember to draw a new location. I wrangled with this for a long time, before settling on a fantastic and easy answer. I created a clearly imbalanced Getaway Car space, that people wanted to go to, but which also drew a new location card.

Balancing the fun
Don't forget that options should be similar in fun, as well as in strength.

In my gangster game, players can take various actions. Some will increase their health. Staying alive is necessary, but it's also boring. Players greatly prefer the actions that give them money, because money is cool — it can be spent on all kinds of stuff. To make health more interesting, I created some new and exciting places for the player to go, but only if they have enough health.

In an earlier version, you would sometimes draw cards. These were interesting, so I paired them with those boring health locations.

In the old Fighting Fantasy "Sorcery" game books, you could be a wizard, and cast all kinds of cool spells, or you could be a warrior, who had... two extra Skill points.

In Radlands, you have three water to spend each turn. However, there are almost no abilities that cost three water. It's a much more interesting choice to choose one of your abilities that costs two, plus one that costs one. One three-cost ability is usually a boring turn.

Imbalance as excitement
Balance is not always good.

In simpler, more fun-based games, imbalance can add excitement. It might not seem like a good idea for some things to be clearly better than others, but when you get them, it's exciting.

In Scrabble, some tiles are blatantly better than others. The blanks are the best tiles by a huge margin. That's imbalanced and a bit unfair, but there's excitement to be had every time you reach into the bag and draw your tiles.

Big Moves
Games where players make a series of small moves are typically boring.

Even the best, like Cold War game Twilight Struggle, are an acquired taste.

It's okay to have lots of turns where something small happens, but these should be punctuated by big turns that really change up the game.

Big moves also allow players more control over their game experience.

In Reef, players build a three-dimensional matrix of coloured plastic "coral" bits. Cards will give a player points if there's a specific pattern of coral on their board. Players can make lots of little patterns, and score a few points each. Alternatively, they can build up to a mega-score, where they build multiple copies of the same pattern, and score the scoring card multiple times at once.

If all moves are about the same magnitude, it also doesn't allow losing players to get back into the game.

Early in the development of my gangster game, you could see who was going to win, by the middle of the game. The player who had the most health and money tokens was in a commanding position, and little could stop them. The game was too incremental. I added numerous flashy effects, such as the Skull, which caused all players to lose half their health, and the Bomb, which caused opponents to lose a very large five health, but you had to successfully keep the token for a full two rounds before it exploded.

Big moves make the player feel free and powerful, like they're exploiting the game. These are the moves that make for memorable gameplay.

Create a class of "big things" — expensive things with big effects that almost break the game.

In Radlands, there are people and effects that cost all your water (the game's resource) for one turn, and have huge effects that almost break the game.
VARIABLE ACTIONS
You should obviously enable big moves by creating some cards/actions/options with high costs and big effects.

However, you should also try to make as many of your options variable as possible, so the players can construct all kinds of big moves of their own.

One way to create variable actions is by having variable costs, with the effect growing or repeating as the player pays more.

In Agricola, you can build fences at a cost of one wood. If you have ten wood, you can build ten fences at once.

Variable effects can also come from combos and setups, that make some turns awesome. If I can line up ten space orcs, I should be able to zap all of them with one shot of my laser gun.

In A Feast For Odin, if you have a trade boat, you can upgrade any number of different green goods to blue. This is a big move, as players will set up for it by collecting green goods, and doing one big trade.

Try to use the word "all" (or each/every) on many of your objects. "Gain 1 fruit for each tree you have" is far more interesting than "gain 3 fruit."

And, if you can't make your actions variable, try combining them.

In Agricola, the "Bake Bread" action just turns some of your grain into food. That's a bit boring, so it's paired with the action that lets you plant things in your fields. This way, players will gather lots of grain, and things to plant, and then do a single big move, and accomplish a lot.

In summation, the size of the moves in your game should vary significantly, ideally as dictated by the players.

Stupid fun
You might say "all this potential for big moves will lead to outrageous and imbalanced stuff happening!" Yes, and it's great fun for the players. It's your job as a designer to make it work.

Players should not feel penned in. They should feel like they can do anything, and "break/exploit the game", even though in reality, you've tested the game thoroughly, and it never gets too out of hand.
Stupid or outrageous fun is still fun, and is often the best kind of fun. As a designer, it's your job to make it work.

In a farming game I was working on, the players could farm a modest amount of crops and animals, and do some other things, within reason. However, I changed my outlook on the game. I wanted to give players more freedom to do what they liked. Once they gained this freedom, however, they started to abuse and break the game. One player created a giant herd of sheep for their wool, bought a sewing machine and a loom, and began to mass-produce clothing. He didn't need that much clothing, but each piece was worth points. Another player ferried in an army of guests, and used his cooking pot to create an inordinate amount of soup to feed these happy visitors, which also earned him copious points.

I was very pleased to see this. These players were having fun. I made sure that these kinds of combos couldn't be set up easily, or be maintained with simple loops of actions. My job wasn't to stop the madness. It was to make sure the madness was fair.

In Radlands, the Gunner card hits all the opponent's unprotected people. (Notice the word "all" in there.) The card High Ground makes all the opponent's people unprotected. This is an obvious combo, but players love it.

Calculation vs. Intuition
There's a spectrum of strategy, from games that are mostly short-term tactics, to those with vast long-term strategy.

Chess vs. Scrabble
Chess and Scrabble are both excellent classic games, at different points on this spectrum.

In Scrabble, a good player is mostly trying to get a good score this turn, but they're also trying to retain good letters on their rack, and not give the opponent a nice spot for next turn. Scrabble play is more about the current turn than about the future.

In Chess, it's all about the long game. One move has no more value than a future move. The player always plans ahead, to the limit of their capacity.

But why do these games differ so much in this way? The answer is that, in Chess, you have perfect information. You know everything that's going on in the game, and can work everything out. It's only your limited ability that stops you working out the entire game, and making the perfect move. In Scrabble, you can't plan ahead with too much certainty, because the bag is full of random letters, and you could draw any of them. Also, you don't know what letters your opponent has.

Mental processes
This all leads me to a fundamental question about your game: what mental process are the players actually using, as they play the game?

In Chess, the player is largely calculating. In Scrabble, the player is largely intuiting. The Scrabble player can't calculate a huge amount, because they don't really know anything, other than what tiles they have right now. They must use their intuition to decide which move is best.

Most game players don't like high levels of calculation. Calculation is about "not messing up." Players generally find intuiting to be a much more enjoyable experience. Intuiting is also much faster than calculation.

Planning ahead
Think about where the strategy horizon is, in your game. How far can you plan ahead? I like to be able to plan ahead, but not with too much certainty.

You remove the ability for forward planning by limiting the amount of information known to the player. Giving each player a secret hand of cards is the standard solution to this problem, but there are many ways to limit information.

Also, force players to re-intuit their strategy, by drip-feeding new information to them. Drawing a card every turn is a good way to do this.

Obviously, don't go too far in the direction of giving new information, or the game will be too chaotic, and it will be impossible to think ahead at all.

Consider the weight of your game, when you decide where the strategy horizon will be. Most games should be intuitive, not calculation-based.

Card Design
This is an article of general advice for designing individual cards and other game objects.

Conditional effects
These are effects that only work if a condition is met.

The Radlands expansion camp "Battering Ram" only works if you have six people.

There's a huge amount of design space and depth in conditional effects. Just pair any condition with any effect. They're relatively elegant, and tie to other actions in a little chain, as the player tries to create the condition.

Uncontrollable conditions
When using conditional effects, the condition must actually be something that the player can control. If it's something the game controls, then it's essentially a complex way of doing randomness.

There's little difference between "gain 6 dollars when your roll for the turn is 6" and "gain a dollar each turn". Another example is a magic amulet that gives you a bonus whenever you defeat a goblin, but you have no control over whether you'll be fighting goblins or not.

The Radlands expansion card Death Ray used to require that you pay six water to fire it. This was a huge cost, for a huge effect. You could get six water at once, by discarding several cards with the water icon in their corner. However, you didn't actually have any control over what cards you drew. Only a few had the water icon. That was an uncontrollable condition. Later, I changed the cost to just discarding any five cards.

Even weirder are uncontrollable conditions, that the opponent controls. The opponent will not just blithely meet the condition for you. This often just stops the opponent from doing the thing.

Several playtesters and I all invented the same camp for the Radlands expansion. It was a "super-hospital" that would restore (heal) exactly two of your injured people. In practice, however, the opponent just never left two of your people injured. They'd injure one, and only attack the other one if they could kill it completely. That outcome was very different from the intended effect of the super-hospital.

Self-synergies
If a player doesn't have enough control over a condition, you can give the card a second effect that helps create the condition.

The Radlands card Zeto Khan lets your event cards happen instantaneously, rather than being delayed. This is fun, but what if you don't draw any event cards? I gave him a second ability, that lets you draw three cards then discard three. This gives you a very high chance of drawing event cards. 

Rule changers
I consider the best category of designs to be the rule-changers. These cards simply make something, or the game, work differently. These can't be easily found, like the other types do. They tend to be simpler, more unique, and more thematic. Try to make more.

The new Obelisk camp from Radlands simply says "When the last card is drawn from the deck, you win."

Downsides
A good way to add a lot of strategy to cards is to create a downside, or undesirable consequence. Make cards that also affect (negatively) your own stuff. This can also be an opportunity for cleaning up the game state. The player can discard useless cards or resources.

Avoid permanent downsides. They're almost always un-fun, no matter how interesting or fair they are. Permanent benefits are great, but keep the downsides to being once-off losses.

Modalism
Let the card do one of two (or more) things. If you have effects that are cool, but often useless, combine them into one card.

The old Magic card "Shatter" would destroy an artifact card. It was necessary for that effect to exist. However, if the opponent didn't have any artifacts, Shatter was useless. These days, they make cards like Abrade instead. It lets you destroy an artifact, OR deal some damage to a creature. This means it's always useful.

Break the rules
Go through all the rules of the game, and make cards that break them.

Give points
Many cards have an ongoing effect, and are thus useful at the start of the game, but become useless later on, as you'll get less time to use them. If your game has a "points" system, give cards with an ongoing effect a high point value. This means players will want to play those cards at the start of the game, for their effect, but also at the end of the game, for their points.

Unwanted cards
Give the player a way to use unwanted cards. This also lets you give out more cards than the player needs, which increases choice.

In Radlands, cards can be "junked". There's an icon in the corner. You discard the card, and do whatever that icon says, rather than actually using the card.

In my gangster game, to play a card, you had to also discard some number of other cards from your hand.

In another of my prototypes, a few actions simply require that you discard one card. It's not much, but it makes every card useful.

Context
Every card should relate to its context. With some situations or other cards, it's more (or less) useful. The player should have to evaluate the card, each time they draw it.

In Radlands, you choose three Camp cards. They do something, and also give you a few cards for your openinng hand. Obelisk doesn't do anything, but gives you an extraordinary three cards. Obelisk did have a downside, though. It began the game already damaged. It was a strong camp, which was fine, but it had no context. It didn't matter what other camps you had. You always took the Obelisk. It was still a fun camp though, so I changed it to destroy itself. Now, it's a weak camp, but an amusing curiosity that you need to evaluate each time you draw it.

There should be no cards you always (or never) play.

However, the player shouldn't just be able to reduce this analysis down to a very simple formula.

My gangster game had a Machine Gun card. It cost some money to play, but would increase all your future damage by 1. What's the strategic analysis created by the Machine Gun? It boils down to whether the game is going to end soon, or go on much longer. If the game is about to end, you don't play this card. If the game will go on for a while, you do play this card, as it's a worthwhile investment. This card's strategic analysis is too easily resolved to a simple question, and the card was culled from the game. (If every card was long-term like this, this card would be appropriate for the game, as you'd have to compare them all with each other. That would be an interesting choice.)

Choices that simply resolve to "am I winning or losing" should also be culled, for the same reason.

Choice of timing
If a choice can be made now or later, both should be viable choices. There should be no card that you always play immediately. There's a lot of strategic depth in choosing timing, without added complexity.

My gangster game also had a Tank card. This card was like the Machine Gun card, but it instead doubled the amount of damage the player did. I made Tank work, by making it destructible. It had its own Health tokens, and protected the player's health. The Tank was discarded when it ran out of Health. This new Tank now had a second purpose — protecting the player, but the card's main ability now required much more strategy. You needed to choose when to play the Tank, because if you played it in the wrong context, other players would pummel you before your next turn, destroying your Tank before you got to use its double damage.

My gangster game also had a "you've found some money" card. You played it, and you got a dollar. There was never any reason to hold this card. You'd always play it, and always play it immediately. The card it became was Kidney Donation. It gained you two dollars, but also cost you two health. This card was super-simple, strategically interesting, was played only some of the time, was usually not played immediately, and was also humorous and relatable.

Catch-Up Mechanics
Being in an unwinnable position sucks. You might as well not be playing the game. Catch-up mechanics keep the game competitive, by giving losing players a leg-up, or holding back the winning players.

Feelbad Catch-up Mechanics
Don't specifically single out and punish people for doing well. Overt catch-up mechanics are anti-meritocratic and feelbad.

In Isle of Skye, you get income each round based on how many people you're behind, on the score track.

Ideally, catch-up mechanics should be unnecessary, or intrinsically built into your game. If you have to add them, at least try to hide them a bit, inside other mechanics. Even if people see the inherent catch-up in the mechanic, the catch-up is not the entire purpose of the mechanic.

There are a few ways to hide catch-up mechanics inside arithmetic, with simple effects that just happen to be worse for players who have more stuff.

In my gangster game, the Showdown effect causes all opponents to lose half their health. The opponents with more health therefore lose more.

Ramps, big moves & pnolitics
Rather than include obvious and anti-meritocratic catch-up mechanics, include ramps and big moves. These things double as catch-up mechanics.

The player only needs a chance of winning, for the game to remain enjoyable. That chance can even create tension, which is probably good.

Big Moves: In Scrabble, home players will typically score 10-25 points per turn. However, if a player uses all their tiles in one turn, for an extra 50 points, or gets a Z on the perfect spot, they can easily score 70-100+ points. If you're a long way behind, you're probably not going to win, but a big move like this is always possible.

Ramps: In the TV show Family Feud, there are three rounds. The last round is worth double points. This way, a team that has lost the two previous rounds can still win.

Politics is a very effective catch-up mechanic, but politics is often terrible in games (except games that are about politics, like many war games.) Players simply gang up on the winner.

The robber in Catan, and the Attack cards in Lords of Waterdeep, are both catch-up mechanics, as long as the players use them correctly, which usually means attacking the leader.

Other strategies
Obscuring the leader is an effective option. If players don't know exactly who's winning, they always feel like they have a chance to win. However, this should be done via hidden information. Players should not simply be able to track who's winning.

In Small World, players gain points, but then keep the points tokens face-down. Players still remember roughly how many points each player has gained. This creates an annoying memory issue, and players just argue about who really has the most points. This is bad.

In Lords of Waterdeep, each player has a hidden "Lord" card, which awards them points at the end of the game, based on some criterion. It's not just a random bonus. Some people will have tried to get lots of points from their Lord, while others won't have. It's not easy to work out who has been focusing on their Lord card objectives, so the winner is therefore obscured until the end. This is good.

Instead of having a catch-up mechanic, one option is to simply have the game end sooner. When one player would get to the point where they're guaranteed to win, make the game end.

Catch-up mechanics are internal workings of your game. If they can be removed, they should be. And, if they have to be there, they should do their thing without being noticed.

Choices
Players want to have lots of interesting choices on their turn, and feel like they're in control of what they're doing.

Choices
A player should have ten things they can do on their turn.

More is fine. Less is probably not. This is such an easy thing to do, so make sure you apply it to your games.

Magic can often lack choices, leading to many "correct turns", with the strategy existing on the other turns. Half the deck's cards are non-functional land cards, and the player's existing cards may not be useful.

In Radlands, there are no "lands", so every card has a function. Also, each card can be "junked" — you discard it for free to get a small effect of some sort. Also, each player has three camp cards in play at the start, which each have an ability. And if all that's not enough, you can pay to draw another card.

Access
Look at your game's components. Look across the board, and at all the cards, tokens, tiles, and chits. How much of it can I interact with, this turn? This is what I call access.

This window of choice should include much of the game.

Access gives the player a feeling of control. The absence of access gives a feeling of powerlessness, or, at best, makes people feel like they're building a ship in a bottle.

In Machi Koro, players buy cards from ten piles. I like the game, and have tried out a few different combinations of cards. However, this game has very minimal replayability, as these ten piles are always the same.

In the "Harbor" expansion, the game shuffles all the piles of cards, and many more, into a giant deck, from which ten random cards are displayed. This destroyed the access, as I could no longer buy the cards I wanted. I had to just buy from the ten random cards. Much of the long-term strategy went out of the game. 

In one of my prototypes, players could move one space per turn. However, this gave them only a few possible spaces they could go to. By simply allowing players to move up to two spaces per turn, they could reach far more spaces.

Race for the Galaxy is an excellent game. In the game, you draw lots of cards, but you also discard cards as the resource to pay for other cards. This lets you see many of the deck's cards, and the game has very high access for a card game.

If you're a beginner designer, worker placement is an excellent foundation for a game. (In a worker placement game, there's a board of spaces. On each player's turn, they put one of their workers on an unoccupied space, and do what it says. Typically, once players run out of workers, they're all returned, and a new round begins.)

Worker placement has very high access, as you can do almost anything you like. It also comes with a reasonable level of player interaction, as players can't take a space that another player has taken.

# Guide to Making Board Games

## accumilation.md
Accumulation
Some things in your game accumulate — they stay or grow. Others are cyclical — they come and go.

Component accumulation
Ideally, things in your game should grow or amass.

Having scores that grow during the game is a kind of accumulation. A useful mental exercise is the following:

Take a look at your game (or any game).

Ignore the rules and scores for a second. Where are the physical components going?

If you have a hand of cards, where are they going? What about resources, and other objects? Are they being discarded, or are they amassing in front of you?

If your components aren't amassing, they probably should be.

In my farm game, planting apple trees felt good. You plant them once, and they give you food for the rest of the game. Pine trees were planted once, and then you'd later cut them down for wood. That felt bad, as nothing long-term was gained. I changed the pine trees, so that you now cut them back to a stump, that never stops growing back.

You need a ramp
Accumulation does all kinds of good things for your game. Ramps also tie the turns together, making for great long-term strategy.

The feeling of progress is a very strong enjoyment factor.

It's quite okay to have cyclical resources or money. However, they should be spent on something that provides permanent benefit.

In Splendor, players take three gem tokens per turn, or they spend gem tokens, to buy cards. These cards provide points, but they also provide a discount on all future purchases. The gems are a cyclical resource — they constantly leave the player, while the bought cards accumulate.

Cyclical play
As I'm growing tired of crap euro games, I'm increasingly looking at the game being played, or at the back of the box. If each player doesn't have their own board or tableau, the game is probably cyclical and terrible, and I don't want to play it. 

I like Agricola, so I made my own farming game. You ran a farm, and periodically, "guests" would come along. You could feed them, and provide housing, clothes, or a fire, to keep them warm. This was how you got points. This was open-ended, so you could satisfy the guests on any scale you liked. Players would often kill off all their animals, or create a great bonfire, rather than build things like buildings or fences. This degree of freedom was great, but after cashing in half their farm, a player was left rather deflated and aimless. They were basically back at the start of the game. What would they do now?

Allowing players to make the game highly cyclical was a huge mistake. They shouldn't have been able to neglect and undo their accumulation to that degree. I didn't understand this mistake at the time, and it killed the game.

Adversarial games
Cyclical play is a huge trap that adversarial games fall into, as attacking the enemy is typically cyclical, not accumulative.

Radlands has no accumulation. It gets lots of fun from other sources, but the absence of a ramp made it much harder to design.

I've played numerous "battle" game prototypes, where the player plays a variety of cards, in order to fight enemies on the board. I get the cards, I play them, and the enemy is defeated. It's nice that I'm closer to victory, or have gained some points, but I still feel exactly the same as I did before. I'm not any stronger. I want to be rewarded with an upgraded gun or something.

In 7 Wonders, each card taken is either a resource or prerequisite, that stays for the rest of the game, and pays for future things. 

Resources, systems, victory
In a bad game, a player takes resources, and spends those resources to achieve victory.

In a good, accumulative game, a player gains resources, spends those resources to create systems, and those systems create victory. (The systems might just create more resources, which create victory. That's fine, too.)

I want to build an orchard, not just be a fruit-picker.

Systems are fun. Victory is not. Victory should just be the natural result of the successful creation of systems.

## awesome.md
Awesome Things
Designers often focus so much on fairness and balance that they forget about the great entertainment value of doing something outrageous.

In Radlands, there are people and effects that cost all your water (the game's resource) for one turn, and have huge effects that almost break the game.

Break the rules
Most of your cards (or other objects) should be simple and straightforward. However, you should also include a few things in your game that break fundamental rules of your game, or seem too amazingly-good to be possible. When someone sees this thing, they should say ""WHAAA?!?!?!"" and immediately imagine the possibilities it opens up. Everything that doesn't just say "I win" should probably be considered for inclusion in your game somewhere.

These things should feel awesome but actually be entirely reasonable.

In Radlands, your location cards are the base for your game. They provide handy abilities that help your own people, or hurt the opponent's. The card "Reactor" blows up and kills all people in play. The card "Juggernaut" is a wheeled city that literally moves across the table, towards the opponent.
In my gangster game, locations let you roll various dice, which have effects on them. The "Corrupt Mayor" location lets you roll seven of the red die — a ridiculous number that's likely to eliminate all the other players. It's suitably expensive to do this, of course.

In Magic, there are "Planeswalker" cards. These are characters of exceptional power, who join you. Typically, each has three different abilities, and the last one is an "ultimate" ability. It might be the case that one of the other abilities is technically better value, but the ultimate ability is something big. Create five dragons, or remove almost all of the opponent's deck from the game, or gain 100 life (you start with 20.)

A good game is enjoyed while you play it. A great game creates an experience you'll remember, and a story you'll want to tell others.

## balance.md
Balance
Balance is when game parts or choices are similar in value.

Yes, Balance is Good
Balance is generally desirable, as it means each option is viable, giving the player real choice. It also means the game is probably fairer, and there are no parts of the game that no one ever uses.

Don't worry about it
Balance is not that important.

Plenty of other things are more important.

Balance is also very easy to achieve. Almost anything can be balanced, which means that you can really do whatever you like, and just balance it all later.

Balance is not the same thing as fun. Do not excuse un-funness for balance reasons.

Chess is still a great game, even though white wins more than black. It's even less important that rooks are better than knights.

I know some cards I make are imbalanced (too strong, or too weak.) That's fine. It just happened that the simple, clean version of the card was imbalanced.

Choose elegance over balance.

As long as the card has some value, and isn't "feelbad" for anyone, I'm happy with it.

The other thing about cards is that a player has many of them. Some will be imbalanced individually, but a hand is likely to be balanced overall.

I do try to make all options balanced, but each option need only be balanced enough to be worthy of consideration by the player. If there are two options, and one is chosen only 25% of the time, that's still fine. 

HOw do I Know What's Balanced?
Someone recently asked me how I balanced Radlands. The real answer is that when balancing something, I just guess, and then play the game. If something is too strong, I make it weaker. If it's too weak, I make it stronger.

If I want something a bit more precise, I'll try to balance something by comparing it to something similar.

If you really want to balance, try to convert everything into your game's "lowest common denominator" resource, so you can roughly compare things.

Don't try to do mathematical calculations beyond that. I've been guilty of trying to balance things with a spreadsheet. It might seem doable, but what's the value of something that's slow, or the value of something that's overkill? There cannot be an absolute system for balance.

Considerations for Balance
Be aware that something might actually be costing a second resource you're not aware of.

One action might cost twice as much as another, and give twice as much reward. However, both actions consume the player's turn, thereby making the bigger action better.

Some cards, in particular, are fair with a cost of zero, because they still cost a card.

A common mistake is to forget to compare the alternative. If there's a space where I can get two gold, and a space where I can spend three gold on a valuable item, what should the item's real value to the player be (if you had to convert it to gold)? Assume that gold and items are both good to have.

If you chose three, that's not balanced. Buying the item loses you three gold and gains you three, for a net gain of zero. The gold space gains you positive two gold. The item should in fact be worth five gold.

Balance with numbers
When you actually want to rebalance something, take note of the following:

A good designer balances by changing numbers. A bad designer adds rules text.

Make sure your cards (or other components) have a number on them. It could be a cost. It could be a points value. This allows easy fine-tuning of balance.

In Radlands, each player starts with three camp cards. These are important. When I started designing these camps, I knew balancing them would be difficult, so I added a numerical component. Every camp card has a number in its corner, and each player draws a starting hand equal to the total of these numbers on their camps. This way, weaker camps can be balanced by having a higher number, and vice versa.

Just make the simplest and nicest version of each object, and then balance it by tweaking its numbers.

Intentional imbalance
Sometimes, you want to imbalance things.

In deck-builder game Dominion, you start the game with a deck of ten bad cards. You add good cards to it, and try to remove the bad ones. The Chapel card can remove four cards from the deck in one turn. This card is amazingly good, but the designer knew that. The idea is that a game with Chapel in it will be distinctly different from other games.

I like to imbalance things that are necessary for the game to progress, or otherwise remain healthy. Every option should be worthy of consideration, but I make these options have a clear edge over the others.

In an earlier version of my gangster game, location cards would come and go throughout the game. I wanted the board to keep changing. I could've said "every turn, or round, draw a new location card." However, I didn't want any kind of turn structure, where players had to remember to draw a new location. I wrangled with this for a long time, before settling on a fantastic and easy answer. I created a clearly imbalanced Getaway Car space, that people wanted to go to, but which also drew a new location card.

Balancing the fun
Don't forget that options should be similar in fun, as well as in strength.

In my gangster game, players can take various actions. Some will increase their health. Staying alive is necessary, but it's also boring. Players greatly prefer the actions that give them money, because money is cool — it can be spent on all kinds of stuff. To make health more interesting, I created some new and exciting places for the player to go, but only if they have enough health.

In an earlier version, you would sometimes draw cards. These were interesting, so I paired them with those boring health locations.

In the old Fighting Fantasy "Sorcery" game books, you could be a wizard, and cast all kinds of cool spells, or you could be a warrior, who had... two extra Skill points.

In Radlands, you have three water to spend each turn. However, there are almost no abilities that cost three water. It's a much more interesting choice to choose one of your abilities that costs two, plus one that costs one. One three-cost ability is usually a boring turn.

Imbalance as excitement
Balance is not always good.

In simpler, more fun-based games, imbalance can add excitement. It might not seem like a good idea for some things to be clearly better than others, but when you get them, it's exciting.

In Scrabble, some tiles are blatantly better than others. The blanks are the best tiles by a huge margin. That's imbalanced and a bit unfair, but there's excitement to be had every time you reach into the bag and draw your tiles.

## bigMoves.md
Big Moves
Games where players make a series of small moves are typically boring.

Even the best, like Cold War game Twilight Struggle, are an acquired taste.

It's okay to have lots of turns where something small happens, but these should be punctuated by big turns that really change up the game.

Big moves also allow players more control over their game experience.

In Reef, players build a three-dimensional matrix of coloured plastic "coral" bits. Cards will give a player points if there's a specific pattern of coral on their board. Players can make lots of little patterns, and score a few points each. Alternatively, they can build up to a mega-score, where they build multiple copies of the same pattern, and score the scoring card multiple times at once.

If all moves are about the same magnitude, it also doesn't allow losing players to get back into the game.

Early in the development of my gangster game, you could see who was going to win, by the middle of the game. The player who had the most health and money tokens was in a commanding position, and little could stop them. The game was too incremental. I added numerous flashy effects, such as the Skull, which caused all players to lose half their health, and the Bomb, which caused opponents to lose a very large five health, but you had to successfully keep the token for a full two rounds before it exploded.

Big moves make the player feel free and powerful, like they're exploiting the game. These are the moves that make for memorable gameplay.

Create a class of "big things" — expensive things with big effects that almost break the game.

In Radlands, there are people and effects that cost all your water (the game's resource) for one turn, and have huge effects that almost break the game.
VARIABLE ACTIONS
You should obviously enable big moves by creating some cards/actions/options with high costs and big effects.

However, you should also try to make as many of your options variable as possible, so the players can construct all kinds of big moves of their own.

One way to create variable actions is by having variable costs, with the effect growing or repeating as the player pays more.

In Agricola, you can build fences at a cost of one wood. If you have ten wood, you can build ten fences at once.

Variable effects can also come from combos and setups, that make some turns awesome. If I can line up ten space orcs, I should be able to zap all of them with one shot of my laser gun.

In A Feast For Odin, if you have a trade boat, you can upgrade any number of different green goods to blue. This is a big move, as players will set up for it by collecting green goods, and doing one big trade.

Try to use the word "all" (or each/every) on many of your objects. "Gain 1 fruit for each tree you have" is far more interesting than "gain 3 fruit."

And, if you can't make your actions variable, try combining them.

In Agricola, the "Bake Bread" action just turns some of your grain into food. That's a bit boring, so it's paired with the action that lets you plant things in your fields. This way, players will gather lots of grain, and things to plant, and then do a single big move, and accomplish a lot.

In summation, the size of the moves in your game should vary significantly, ideally as dictated by the players.

Stupid fun
You might say "all this potential for big moves will lead to outrageous and imbalanced stuff happening!" Yes, and it's great fun for the players. It's your job as a designer to make it work.

Players should not feel penned in. They should feel like they can do anything, and "break/exploit the game", even though in reality, you've tested the game thoroughly, and it never gets too out of hand.
Stupid or outrageous fun is still fun, and is often the best kind of fun. As a designer, it's your job to make it work.

In a farming game I was working on, the players could farm a modest amount of crops and animals, and do some other things, within reason. However, I changed my outlook on the game. I wanted to give players more freedom to do what they liked. Once they gained this freedom, however, they started to abuse and break the game. One player created a giant herd of sheep for their wool, bought a sewing machine and a loom, and began to mass-produce clothing. He didn't need that much clothing, but each piece was worth points. Another player ferried in an army of guests, and used his cooking pot to create an inordinate amount of soup to feed these happy visitors, which also earned him copious points.

I was very pleased to see this. These players were having fun. I made sure that these kinds of combos couldn't be set up easily, or be maintained with simple loops of actions. My job wasn't to stop the madness. It was to make sure the madness was fair.

In Radlands, the Gunner card hits all the opponent's unprotected people. (Notice the word "all" in there.) The card High Ground makes all the opponent's people unprotected. This is an obvious combo, but players love it.

## calculationsVsIntuition.md
Calculation vs. Intuition
There's a spectrum of strategy, from games that are mostly short-term tactics, to those with vast long-term strategy.

Chess vs. Scrabble
Chess and Scrabble are both excellent classic games, at different points on this spectrum.

In Scrabble, a good player is mostly trying to get a good score this turn, but they're also trying to retain good letters on their rack, and not give the opponent a nice spot for next turn. Scrabble play is more about the current turn than about the future.

In Chess, it's all about the long game. One move has no more value than a future move. The player always plans ahead, to the limit of their capacity.

But why do these games differ so much in this way? The answer is that, in Chess, you have perfect information. You know everything that's going on in the game, and can work everything out. It's only your limited ability that stops you working out the entire game, and making the perfect move. In Scrabble, you can't plan ahead with too much certainty, because the bag is full of random letters, and you could draw any of them. Also, you don't know what letters your opponent has.

Mental processes
This all leads me to a fundamental question about your game: what mental process are the players actually using, as they play the game?

In Chess, the player is largely calculating. In Scrabble, the player is largely intuiting. The Scrabble player can't calculate a huge amount, because they don't really know anything, other than what tiles they have right now. They must use their intuition to decide which move is best.

Most game players don't like high levels of calculation. Calculation is about "not messing up." Players generally find intuiting to be a much more enjoyable experience. Intuiting is also much faster than calculation.

Planning ahead
Think about where the strategy horizon is, in your game. How far can you plan ahead? I like to be able to plan ahead, but not with too much certainty.

You remove the ability for forward planning by limiting the amount of information known to the player. Giving each player a secret hand of cards is the standard solution to this problem, but there are many ways to limit information.

Also, force players to re-intuit their strategy, by drip-feeding new information to them. Drawing a card every turn is a good way to do this.

Obviously, don't go too far in the direction of giving new information, or the game will be too chaotic, and it will be impossible to think ahead at all.

Consider the weight of your game, when you decide where the strategy horizon will be. Most games should be intuitive, not calculation-based.

## cardDesign.md
Card Design
This is an article of general advice for designing individual cards and other game objects.

Conditional effects
These are effects that only work if a condition is met.

The Radlands expansion camp "Battering Ram" only works if you have six people.

There's a huge amount of design space and depth in conditional effects. Just pair any condition with any effect. They're relatively elegant, and tie to other actions in a little chain, as the player tries to create the condition.

Uncontrollable conditions
When using conditional effects, the condition must actually be something that the player can control. If it's something the game controls, then it's essentially a complex way of doing randomness.

There's little difference between "gain 6 dollars when your roll for the turn is 6" and "gain a dollar each turn". Another example is a magic amulet that gives you a bonus whenever you defeat a goblin, but you have no control over whether you'll be fighting goblins or not.

The Radlands expansion card Death Ray used to require that you pay six water to fire it. This was a huge cost, for a huge effect. You could get six water at once, by discarding several cards with the water icon in their corner. However, you didn't actually have any control over what cards you drew. Only a few had the water icon. That was an uncontrollable condition. Later, I changed the cost to just discarding any five cards.

Even weirder are uncontrollable conditions, that the opponent controls. The opponent will not just blithely meet the condition for you. This often just stops the opponent from doing the thing.

Several playtesters and I all invented the same camp for the Radlands expansion. It was a "super-hospital" that would restore (heal) exactly two of your injured people. In practice, however, the opponent just never left two of your people injured. They'd injure one, and only attack the other one if they could kill it completely. That outcome was very different from the intended effect of the super-hospital.

Self-synergies
If a player doesn't have enough control over a condition, you can give the card a second effect that helps create the condition.

The Radlands card Zeto Khan lets your event cards happen instantaneously, rather than being delayed. This is fun, but what if you don't draw any event cards? I gave him a second ability, that lets you draw three cards then discard three. This gives you a very high chance of drawing event cards. 

Rule changers
I consider the best category of designs to be the rule-changers. These cards simply make something, or the game, work differently. These can't be easily found, like the other types do. They tend to be simpler, more unique, and more thematic. Try to make more.

The new Obelisk camp from Radlands simply says "When the last card is drawn from the deck, you win."

Downsides
A good way to add a lot of strategy to cards is to create a downside, or undesirable consequence. Make cards that also affect (negatively) your own stuff. This can also be an opportunity for cleaning up the game state. The player can discard useless cards or resources.

Avoid permanent downsides. They're almost always un-fun, no matter how interesting or fair they are. Permanent benefits are great, but keep the downsides to being once-off losses.

Modalism
Let the card do one of two (or more) things. If you have effects that are cool, but often useless, combine them into one card.

The old Magic card "Shatter" would destroy an artifact card. It was necessary for that effect to exist. However, if the opponent didn't have any artifacts, Shatter was useless. These days, they make cards like Abrade instead. It lets you destroy an artifact, OR deal some damage to a creature. This means it's always useful.

Break the rules
Go through all the rules of the game, and make cards that break them.

Give points
Many cards have an ongoing effect, and are thus useful at the start of the game, but become useless later on, as you'll get less time to use them. If your game has a "points" system, give cards with an ongoing effect a high point value. This means players will want to play those cards at the start of the game, for their effect, but also at the end of the game, for their points.

Unwanted cards
Give the player a way to use unwanted cards. This also lets you give out more cards than the player needs, which increases choice.

In Radlands, cards can be "junked". There's an icon in the corner. You discard the card, and do whatever that icon says, rather than actually using the card.

In my gangster game, to play a card, you had to also discard some number of other cards from your hand.

In another of my prototypes, a few actions simply require that you discard one card. It's not much, but it makes every card useful.

Context
Every card should relate to its context. With some situations or other cards, it's more (or less) useful. The player should have to evaluate the card, each time they draw it.

In Radlands, you choose three Camp cards. They do something, and also give you a few cards for your openinng hand. Obelisk doesn't do anything, but gives you an extraordinary three cards. Obelisk did have a downside, though. It began the game already damaged. It was a strong camp, which was fine, but it had no context. It didn't matter what other camps you had. You always took the Obelisk. It was still a fun camp though, so I changed it to destroy itself. Now, it's a weak camp, but an amusing curiosity that you need to evaluate each time you draw it.

There should be no cards you always (or never) play.

However, the player shouldn't just be able to reduce this analysis down to a very simple formula.

My gangster game had a Machine Gun card. It cost some money to play, but would increase all your future damage by 1. What's the strategic analysis created by the Machine Gun? It boils down to whether the game is going to end soon, or go on much longer. If the game is about to end, you don't play this card. If the game will go on for a while, you do play this card, as it's a worthwhile investment. This card's strategic analysis is too easily resolved to a simple question, and the card was culled from the game. (If every card was long-term like this, this card would be appropriate for the game, as you'd have to compare them all with each other. That would be an interesting choice.)

Choices that simply resolve to "am I winning or losing" should also be culled, for the same reason.

Choice of timing
If a choice can be made now or later, both should be viable choices. There should be no card that you always play immediately. There's a lot of strategic depth in choosing timing, without added complexity.

My gangster game also had a Tank card. This card was like the Machine Gun card, but it instead doubled the amount of damage the player did. I made Tank work, by making it destructible. It had its own Health tokens, and protected the player's health. The Tank was discarded when it ran out of Health. This new Tank now had a second purpose — protecting the player, but the card's main ability now required much more strategy. You needed to choose when to play the Tank, because if you played it in the wrong context, other players would pummel you before your next turn, destroying your Tank before you got to use its double damage.

My gangster game also had a "you've found some money" card. You played it, and you got a dollar. There was never any reason to hold this card. You'd always play it, and always play it immediately. The card it became was Kidney Donation. It gained you two dollars, but also cost you two health. This card was super-simple, strategically interesting, was played only some of the time, was usually not played immediately, and was also humorous and relatable.

## catchUp.md
Catch-Up Mechanics
Being in an unwinnable position sucks. You might as well not be playing the game. Catch-up mechanics keep the game competitive, by giving losing players a leg-up, or holding back the winning players.

Feelbad Catch-up Mechanics
Don't specifically single out and punish people for doing well. Overt catch-up mechanics are anti-meritocratic and feelbad.

In Isle of Skye, you get income each round based on how many people you're behind, on the score track.

Ideally, catch-up mechanics should be unnecessary, or intrinsically built into your game. If you have to add them, at least try to hide them a bit, inside other mechanics. Even if people see the inherent catch-up in the mechanic, the catch-up is not the entire purpose of the mechanic.

There are a few ways to hide catch-up mechanics inside arithmetic, with simple effects that just happen to be worse for players who have more stuff.

In my gangster game, the Showdown effect causes all opponents to lose half their health. The opponents with more health therefore lose more.

Ramps, big moves & pnolitics
Rather than include obvious and anti-meritocratic catch-up mechanics, include ramps and big moves. These things double as catch-up mechanics.

The player only needs a chance of winning, for the game to remain enjoyable. That chance can even create tension, which is probably good.

Big Moves: In Scrabble, home players will typically score 10-25 points per turn. However, if a player uses all their tiles in one turn, for an extra 50 points, or gets a Z on the perfect spot, they can easily score 70-100+ points. If you're a long way behind, you're probably not going to win, but a big move like this is always possible.

Ramps: In the TV show Family Feud, there are three rounds. The last round is worth double points. This way, a team that has lost the two previous rounds can still win.

Politics is a very effective catch-up mechanic, but politics is often terrible in games (except games that are about politics, like many war games.) Players simply gang up on the winner.

The robber in Catan, and the Attack cards in Lords of Waterdeep, are both catch-up mechanics, as long as the players use them correctly, which usually means attacking the leader.

Other strategies
Obscuring the leader is an effective option. If players don't know exactly who's winning, they always feel like they have a chance to win. However, this should be done via hidden information. Players should not simply be able to track who's winning.

In Small World, players gain points, but then keep the points tokens face-down. Players still remember roughly how many points each player has gained. This creates an annoying memory issue, and players just argue about who really has the most points. This is bad.

In Lords of Waterdeep, each player has a hidden "Lord" card, which awards them points at the end of the game, based on some criterion. It's not just a random bonus. Some people will have tried to get lots of points from their Lord, while others won't have. It's not easy to work out who has been focusing on their Lord card objectives, so the winner is therefore obscured until the end. This is good.

Instead of having a catch-up mechanic, one option is to simply have the game end sooner. When one player would get to the point where they're guaranteed to win, make the game end.

Catch-up mechanics are internal workings of your game. If they can be removed, they should be. And, if they have to be there, they should do their thing without being noticed.

## choices.md
Choices
Players want to have lots of interesting choices on their turn, and feel like they're in control of what they're doing.

Choices
A player should have ten things they can do on their turn.

More is fine. Less is probably not. This is such an easy thing to do, so make sure you apply it to your games.

Magic can often lack choices, leading to many "correct turns", with the strategy existing on the other turns. Half the deck's cards are non-functional land cards, and the player's existing cards may not be useful.

In Radlands, there are no "lands", so every card has a function. Also, each card can be "junked" — you discard it for free to get a small effect of some sort. Also, each player has three camp cards in play at the start, which each have an ability. And if all that's not enough, you can pay to draw another card.

Access
Look at your game's components. Look across the board, and at all the cards, tokens, tiles, and chits. How much of it can I interact with, this turn? This is what I call access.

This window of choice should include much of the game.

Access gives the player a feeling of control. The absence of access gives a feeling of powerlessness, or, at best, makes people feel like they're building a ship in a bottle.

In Machi Koro, players buy cards from ten piles. I like the game, and have tried out a few different combinations of cards. However, this game has very minimal replayability, as these ten piles are always the same.

In the "Harbor" expansion, the game shuffles all the piles of cards, and many more, into a giant deck, from which ten random cards are displayed. This destroyed the access, as I could no longer buy the cards I wanted. I had to just buy from the ten random cards. Much of the long-term strategy went out of the game. 

In one of my prototypes, players could move one space per turn. However, this gave them only a few possible spaces they could go to. By simply allowing players to move up to two spaces per turn, they could reach far more spaces.

Race for the Galaxy is an excellent game. In the game, you draw lots of cards, but you also discard cards as the resource to pay for other cards. This lets you see many of the deck's cards, and the game has very high access for a card game.

If you're a beginner designer, worker placement is an excellent foundation for a game. (In a worker placement game, there's a board of spaces. On each player's turn, they put one of their workers on an unoccupied space, and do what it says. Typically, once players run out of workers, they're all returned, and a new round begins.)

Worker placement has very high access, as you can do almost anything you like. It also comes with a reasonable level of player interaction, as players can't take a space that another player has taken.

## components.md
Component Limitations
Your game should use as few pieces as possible, and they should be the standard game pieces.

Keep it small
If you don't understand this, a publisher will teach it to you the hard way, when they insist you cut down your game, or, far more likely, just reject it outright.

Minimising components isn't as important as fun, simplicity, or other matters, but it's certainly next on the list. You should be considering it as you design your game.

You're also giving your players, who don't have infinite money, more value for their money.

It's a big cost for a publisher to print vast quantities of components. Do you really need all those dice in the game? Does each player need to have a separate deck? Can that deck be half the size, and still work the same? Does the board need to be huge?

Always try to make your game with standard components. Almost all games can be done this way, and still look great.

Standard pieces are regular dice (4-20 sided dice are fairly standard too), simple coloured wooden bits (various cubes, discs, men), punchboard (thick cardboard for boards, chits, and other flat pieces), and cards.

Things like custom dice (dice with faces that aren't numbers), and unusual resource tokens (fancy resource shapes, animal shapes) are still mostly acceptable.

Miniatures and other custom-moulded plastic pieces are very expensive.

Artwork
It's not the amount of art that goes into your game, it's the amount of unique art that goes into the game. Most cards in your decks should exist as multiple copies of the same card. There should be a few rarer cards that only exist as singles, but most cards should be doubles or triples.

Use both sides
A deck of cards you draw from, during the game, can't be double-sided. Most other things can.

Boards, chits, and cards not in decks, can all have a second side. This is a great way to fit everything onto less components, or add variation.

If you have two things that don't work well together, or do something very similar, you can just put them on opposite sides of the same component, so they can never both be in the game at the same time.

Make sure that all components are being used regularly. Do not include components that are only occasionally used.

Every component in the game must be entirely necessary.

## coreMechanics.md
The Core
The central mechanic or mechanics you choose become the core of your game. In a way, the core is your game.

Just the core, please
Once you've worked out your core, remove everything else from your game, other than what's needed to support and enhance the core. I want to be playing your amazing core, not a whole lot of other stuff.

Dominion was the first "deck-builder" game (each player starts with a weak deck, and uses its cards to buy more and better cards to shuffle into it.) The designer originally had this as the core of a much larger game, but, in the end, he removed all that extra stuff, and the game was a hit.

Many designers think they need to make an epic game around their core, but the correct choice is often a relatively simple, half-an-hour game. Each irrelevant or extraneous thing you add, makes your game worse.

If your game is about one thing, and that thing is great, then your game is great. If it's about ten different activities, then they all need to be great, for the game to be great.

There's no point adding anything else to your game, or proceeding, until you have a good core. Do not go off and work on other parts of the game. No amount of good ideas, work, art, and other things matter if the core doesn't work.

Clarity
There's a second advantage of just focussing on the core of your game.

Imagine the following game (I just made it up):

There's a ten by ten grid. On each of your turns, you add a stone of your colour to the board. Players cannot place stones adjacent (including diagonal) to their opponent's stones. The player with the most stones on the board at the end wins.

It's nice that this game has such simple rules, and can be understood so easily. You can start strategising immediately.

The game above is an interesting puzzle, precisely because it's a very simple and clear problem. It's not a sprawling array of mechanics, but poses a very stark and simple question to you. If this example interests you, it's not going to be made more interesting if I add extra things on top of it.

I call this clarity. The more your game is about its central challenge, the more clarity it has.

This game is not interesting enough for me to want to play it twice, but it is interesting momentarily.

Give the players a distilled experience of one simple concept.

## deckDesign.md
Deck Design
A deck is a single thing, that serves a purpose. It's not just a collection of cool cards.

Simple
What are the simplest possible cards that could exist in your game? They should exist, because their complexity is super-low, and their gameplay value might be reasonable. Many of your cards should be nothing more than an icon. Most should be one sentence, and maybe an icon. Next, do cards that have two icons on them, or an icon and a sentence of text. Then, two sentences.

Look at every rule of your game, and make a card that breaks it in some way.

Not all of these cards will work, but you should try them.

Straightforward
In addition, most of the deck should be composed of cards that do very straightforward things. They shouldn't be situational or unusual or flashy. They should be things you'd usually want, even if those things are boring on their own. The hand as a whole is what's interesting, not the individual cards.

When players draw a hand of cards, it should be very easy to understand, useful, and maybe have one wacky or exciting card.

A deck is a deck, not a collection of cards. Most of its contents will be boring and functional.

how many cards?
To further simplify the deck, and make it more functional, I skew card decks heavily towards the aforementioned simple & straightforward cards. I put three to five of those cards in the deck, and only one or two of each of the exciting and strange ones.

I try to keep decks as small as possible, especially if the deck isn't the core of the game. You can easily make a deck much better, by halving its size, and keeping only the best half.

Predictability
There's also another axis to consider here: predictability. I like to add strategy to games with cards, by giving the players some idea of what cards the opponent will play. If there are some common cards in the deck, a player can anticipate them, and strategise accordingly.

If the deck is full of unique cards, players won't be able to strategise at all. The opponent's cards will just hit them out of the blue, and it will be feelbad. 

Use a deck
A general piece of advice here: Cards do a lot of good things for a game. They provide choices. They're a well ofrdepth and replayability. They help tie turns together. If the cards are in players' hands, they're hidden information, and which pushes your game away from calculability, and towards intuition.

Most games should have a deck of cards.

Deck construction
Avoid "deck construction" (this is where players can modify or build their own deck before the game.) Many players will not want to play a complex metagame on top of your game. Deck construction also likely requires multiple products, to enable the full spectrum of deck-construction possibilities. It probably also necessitates a community, where you can trade for cards you want for your deck. The vast majority of players don't want to interact this strongly with a game, or do non-game activities. If they do, they can just play a game like Magic, which is designed specifically around that concept. Publishers are also likely to shy away from competing with the giants that already dominate this field.

Just make a normal game.

## depthComplexity.md
The Depth: Complexity Ratio
Design your game not just for maximum depth, but also for minimum complexity.

This is probably the most important article on this site.

Depth is how strategic and interesting something is.

Your simple game isn't going to be as deep as Through the Ages or Agricola, but most people aren't interested in complex, brain-burner games that take several hours. They want something they can easily understand and be competitive in, the first time they play it.

Your game is not competing with heavier or lighter games. It is competing only with games of the same complexity.

The Depth:Complexity ratio is central to my design process, not an afterthought or minor matter. Many designers seem to ignore it entirely.

Minimise complexity
Think of complexity as a kind of money you can spend. When you spend it, you want to add as much good stuff to your game as possible. Also, you want to "sell" (remove) parts of your game that are complex, but don't add much to the game. That complexity can then be re-spent elsewhere, to add something that adds cool gameplay.

I've played and playtested many games that had all kinds of rules, bits, and procedures, but amounted to nothing more than a simple puzzle. If I want to play a simple puzzle game, I'll play Splendor or Azul, not the same game wrapped up in cumbersome and complex baggage.

It might sound counterintuitive to remove a part of your game that adds positive gameplay, but if it generates enough of a reduction in complexity, it's a good thing, even if you don't re-spend that complexity elsewhere. You need to let your game slide around on the complexity scale. It's okay if it ends up more or less complex than you had intended, if its ratio will be optimised.

My epic pirate adventure ended up as a small, simple pick-up-and-deliver game, with a few dice. It was better for it.

My farming game is big and involved. However, I managed to remove enough complexity from it, so that it's appealing to most mid-weight gamers.

The Depth:Complexity ratio isn't linear. Increased complexity enables exponentially greater gameplay. This means that more complex games and elements must be vastly better than the simpler ones.

You might think your game is fairly simple, for what it is, and that only the necessary stuff is in there. That's almost certainly not the case. Your game is far more complicated than you think it is.

Coming up with complex things is easy. Coming up with simple things is hard.

There are all kinds of other benefits of simplicity, that I'll talk about later in the site.

Elegance
A finished game should be elegant — it should appear childishly simple, and not far from self-explanatory. It should not be covered in text, keywords, icons, and numbers, and look complicated. It should look so simple that people assume it's a very light game.

Strategic depth should come from the interaction of many simple parts, not from the internal complexity of complex parts.

Radlands is so elegant that people initially looked at it and said "I don't see what's good here", but the game ended up being an enormous success, with people lauding its simplicity.

## endingTheGame.md
Making Sure the Game Ends
A game's length should not vary too much above its typical length. If it does, it can become boring, or cause issues for the players.

In the classic game Diplomacy, players' pieces battle for control of Europe. The pieces are not destroyed, and can simply push each other back and forth forever.

Ratchets
A game's features should push it towards a conclusion. I call such systems "ratchets". A "hard ratchet" moves the game continuously and irreversibly in one direction. The game might end in a set number of rounds. This is a hard ratchet.

 A "soft ratchet" generally moves the game in one direction, but the game can move backwards, or simply stay where it is. The end of the game is inevitable, but getting there could be slow or quick.

Most games have inherent ratchets in them. If your game doesn't, put one in.

Dwindling components
Scrabble has 100 tiles, which are depleted at a fairly predictable rate, after which, the game ends. This is a fairly hard ratchet.

Chess has two softer ratchets — the fact that pawns can't go backwards, and, more importantly, the fact that captured pieces do not return. However, pawns often become stuck, and the game still works without them. Unlike Scrabble, Chess turns can be played without the loss of components. Pieces can just keep moving around. All this makes Chess games vary in length much more than games of Scrabble do.

The Ramp
This is a ratchet that gets harder and harder as the game progresses.

Some number in the game is inexorably increased. This causes effects to increase in magnitude, and become more likely to end the game.

Poker continually ramps up the blinds (automatic starting bids), until players are playing with very large proportions of their money each hand. Each player is only a few hands away from elimination, and players are thus rapidly eliminated.

A ramp can also be good for other reasons. It makes the game bigger and more exciting, or just different, as it goes on.

The backup ratchet
Magic has a Ramp built into it — the "land" system. Players play more and more land cards, which facilitate larger and larger spells. This doesn't necessarily mean the game will end though. However, there's another ratchet: a game of Magic also ends when one player's deck runs out. That's rare, but it stops a very small number of super-slow games becoming never-ending games.

If you can't guarantee your ratchet, it can be wise to put a much slower but more certain ratchet behind it, by declaring that a dwindling resource eventually triggers game-end, if nothing else does.

Finishers
Similarly to Magic, in my gangster game, players have health, and they lose the game when their health falls to zero.

The game is slanted in the direction of decreasing health, but not heavily. Players can gain significant amounts of health, as well as lose it. In some setups, and with a bit of luck, players can stay alive for a very long time, despite the slant.

I added a number of "finisher" locations into the game. These are places a player can go, that have a good chance of eliminating players. These places cost large amounts of money to go to, so they can't be accessed too early, or without effort, but they're like mini-ramps, where the volatility of the game briefly skyrockets, and even entrenched players can be eliminated.
The slant
Magic also has another ratchet, a life total. When a player's life total is reduced to zero, they lose the game. There's nothing stopping them from gaining life, however. Despite the face that a player can gain life, they usually don't gain much.

The game is statistically slanted in the direction of decreasing life totals, and usually ends in reasonable time.

Reliability of ratchets
Your ratchets must work under all circumstances. They can't rely on certain cards being drawn (unless those cards are extremely common.)

Earlier in the design of my gangster game, I added Machine Gun item cards as ramps. These would make you permanently do more damage to the other players. However, these cards could be on the bottom of the deck, and players weren't compelled to use the card when they drew it.

Similarly, my finisher locations might not be present on the table in a particular game. I changed the distribution of the cards such that one finisher location was always present, and made sure that all of them were at least reasonably lethal.

If your game only has a soft ratchet, look at each thing in the game, and ask "Does this progress the game"?

The entire game is a decline, or an ascent. Look at it as a whole, rather than from one player's POV.

Just use a hard ratchet
I've struggled a lot with soft ratchets, and my strong feeling, these days, is just to use a hard ratchet. If your game doesn't have one, add a new system that's a hard ratchet.

One of the biggest ongoing problems with Radlands, that can't really ever be completely fixed, has been games that take way longer than the average game length. The game has no real ratchets, so I've just had to bake slants in all over the place. I think I've largely mitigated the problem, but it's pushed the game very much towards aggressive play.

Alternate win conditions
These days, I'm a big fan of having multiple ways to win. If your game has a win condition other than points (or whoever has the most of something), you should add points as well. Alternate win conditions function a bit like a catch-up mechanism, in that a losing player may still be able to win on one win condition, making the game still fun. They're also a hard ratchet.

In my gangster game, I ended up adding two ratchets. One is "gang members", which increases the damage you do to other players, when you attack. As this number approaches 10, the opponents' chance of survival gets very low. That's a strong ratchet, but it's not guaranteed to work.

I also added points, which I called "reputation". You win the game if you get 10. It's not the usual way to win, but it kicks in, in longer games. Trying to make the game end without this ratchet had been an intractable problem.

## feelbad.md
Feelbad Situations
Feelbad situations are where the player feels bad about something that happens during the game. It doesn't matter why players feel bad, or if their misfortune is actually fair. Avoid creating these situations.

Don't penalise
In general, winning players should gain points or resources, rather than losing players lose them. It can work out exactly the same, but the feeling is different.

No one gains any points. Ben, you lose 5 points!
Aww...

Don't interfere with my stuff
Ben: I spend the ten gold I've collected, to buy this cool horse! Yeah! Now I'll be able to gallop around. I'll go and attack the dragon now.

Tom: The dragon attacks you. It rolls a 6. Your horse and all your equipment are destroyed.

I was enjoying building up my character. Now, I'm back at the start of the game. Penalise the player in some way that doesn't send the game back in time.

Have a second prize
Another feelbad situation is when a player gets no recognition for what they achieved, because it's an all-or-nothing system.

If you meet the objective, you get rewarded. If you almost meet it, you get nothing.

In 7 Wonders, you can put a lot of effort into your military, but if your neighbour is one point stronger than you, you get nothing. Also, you wasted all those resources on military, and the people who didn't even try to do military will be well ahead of you.

Avoid making "all or nothing" mechanics. Game scores should proportionally reflect who did well over the course of the game.

"Strictly worse" outcomes
Randomness can often be very feelbad.

Getting a bad roll or card draw is feelbad, but, obviously, not all rolls or draws can be the same.

When a player gets something "bad", don't make it clearly worse than another option, in every way. Just make it different in some way, to hide the fact that it's worse. If you have a Spear with scores 3 and 3, it's fine to have an Axe with 1 and 4, even though it might be worse. It at least has some upside over the Spear. What's not okay is to have a Sword with 2 and 2. This is strictly worse than the Spear, and the player who gets it will feel ripped off. Obviously, if these things have costs or other factors, it's fine. Also, if the better version is rare, and the weaker one is common, that's fine, too. People will expect the weak Sword, and be pleasantly surprised to draw the stronger Spear.

Make it different in some way, to try to muddy the waters a bit.

In my gangster game, I had a die that causes other players to lose an amount of health. One face of this die was just the "1" — one damage. This roll felt terrible. I decided to turn the "1" roll into "Shakedown". This meant that each opponent could give you a dollar, and if they didn't, then they'd lose one health. This was still a poor roll, but people were usually pleased to gain a dollar or two, and they didn't feel like they just rolled the worst option.

Restrictions
Do not force the player to do something, where they once had a choice. "You cannot move" might be a fair effect in some game, but it's probably not good design. Do not interfere with regular card draw.

It doesn't matter if it's fair or not, avoid taking players' choices away.

Do not make loss of choice and good strategy one and the same. If an effect says "do this if you have no cards in hand", the player will just waste their cards, and do it, and then have no choices afterwards.

If you have unique player powers, or other effects that change the game, they should be positive. Prohibiting or penalising things is almost always disliked by players. Even making them neutral effects that simply change how things work, is often annoying for players.

In my gangster game, each player has a criminal "profile" dealt to them at the start of the game. These change the rules somewhat, for that player, for that game. Junkie had to spend his money to buy health, every turn, and Loner gained information instead of gang members. These characters were thematic and fair, but they were annoying to play. Almost all profiles are now positive, giving an extra ability.

In the Radlands expansion, I was trying all kinds of outrageous camp card designs. They variously stopped you: playing people cards, "junking" (discarding unwanted cards for a small benefit), restoring (healing), or drawing your card for the turn. These all gave some powerful bonus, but they were all miserable to play.

## gameLength.md
Game Length
How long should a game be? As short as possible.

There is nothing inherently better about a game being longer. As with game weight, length can enable deeper play, but doesn't add anything on its own. A shorter game can just be played twice. As before, a shorter game appeals to more people. Your game is not competing with five-hour epic saga games that few people have time for.

For a game that ramps up, the game should be just long enough to allow the player to reach some of the biggest stuff in the game, if they choose to aim for it. It should be no longer. If a player can follow all paths to their end, the game is too long.

A good game ends one turn too soon.

If a game doesn't ramp up, or the ramping-up doesn't change the gameplay much, then the game can be even shorter. You just need a handful of game rounds, so a player gets the feel of the game, and can go through the basic game loop a few times, with their knowledge increasing each time.

Shortening a game
Properly minimising the turn structure will obviously help speed up a game, but a game might just be inherently long.

If your game has rounds, have as few as possible.

If your game has a goal, reduce its size.

If your game is too long, just lop off part (or most) of the game, and just save the best part.

One of my earliest prototypes had three stages, that ramped up nicely. It took an hour or so to play. All the stages were interesting, but the last one was a bit cumbersome. I just removed it. The end result is a 30-minute, medium-light game. It's better, and far shorter. 

My approach
A hundred years ago, many games took a few hours, with a short game being one hour, and a long game taking all afternoon.

These days, a few hours is considered to be on the long side for a game. An hour or so is normal, and half an hour is a short game.

This is still unnecessarily long.

A game's length should match its complexity and level of involvement. I design mostly at medium-light, which is the weight I recommend for most games. At that weight, aim for a game duration of 30 minutes.

Radlands is more mid-weight than medium-light. Its length, on average, is about 30 minutes. 

I can get everything done, in almost every game I design, in half an hour. I've never designed a game that goes for more than an hour.

Keep it short.

## gatekeepers.md
Gatekeepers and Control
Remember the example earlier in this site, with the room of 100 designers, from which maybe one game would be published?

Twenty of those guys are going to Kickstarter, because they all know their game is the one that should have been published.

Control
One of the reasons people go to Kickstarter is that it allows them to have complete control over their game, from rules to artwork. People like this. Many such designers are also resistant to feedback from me, and from other designers.

Control also allows a designer to design what they want, free of constraints that a publisher would likely impose. Publishers won't want games with certain business models, excessive components, or themes that are overused, fringe, or distasteful.

Some designers view their game as a personal art project, or creative challenge, and it therefore can't be adulterated by someone else. Of course, the designer will then try to publish the game — usually via Kickstarter. These designers live in a perfect world, where they can naively design what's most enjoyable for them, and have it also happen to be exactly what players want!

Dodging the gatekeepers
Maintaining control is a fatal mistake. The designer believes they're defending their game against ill-conceived changes by a publisher. More likely, it's paranoia, and signals an unwillingness to accept input. The publisher likely knows what they're doing, and is proposing sensible changes.

Like a football player running through the enemy team's lines, carrying the ball, this designer dodges playtesters and publishers — everyone who could give them the vital information they need about their game — that it's bad, or flawed.

A publisher is a brutal gatekeeper, who will force you to make better games, by rejecting your games, until you make a game that really is good enough. You think your current design is such a game, but it isn't.

Kickstarter
Kickstarter is a way for all kinds of kids to bypass the "you must be this tall to go on this ride" sign. They will fall off the ride and die, the same way that crap games will inevitably disappoint their purchasers.

I've always been sceptical of buying games from Kickstarter. After playing so many unpublishable prototypes, and watching them go to Kickstarter, I'm now loath to even play an unproven game from Kickstarter.

I've seen a few good games come from Kickstarter, but I've seen vastly more mediocre and unpolished drek.

Freedom
I could ask for more power, but I don't need to.

For the Radlands expansion, they just gave me complete control, without me even asking. That was a very good decision by them.

Even with this freedom, I don't just lock myself in a room, like Isaac Newton. I have a team of playtesters now, and their input is central to my work.

I didn't have control with Radlands. I had to work on an equal footing with an in-house developer. That was also a very good decision, because I wasn't good enough back then, and Roxley forced me to improve Radlands.

By the time you're in a position to ask for control, you won't need to. In the meantime, be happy to work with others.

## generalBenefit.md
General Benefit
Choices are only choices if they lead to known outcomes.

Options must be evaluable
Some choices seem strategic, but actually lack information that the player would base their decision on.

My gangster game once had three dice you could roll. One die got you money, another attacked the other players, and another gave a variety of useful effects and bonuses.

So, what's wrong here?

With the first two dice, you could plan out a strategy involving them. With the last die, you didn't know what you're going to get, so you couldn't plan anything.

To fix this problem, I increased the strength of the last die. However, the strategy remained the same. If you were winning, you'd roll this die, because it was good. And then, you'd probably be winning by even more. If you were losing, you had to formulate a specific plan, and roll one of the other dice.

Despite the last die being complex, the strategy ended up being too simple.

These days, there are four dice, and each does a very different and specific thing.

General strengthening
Avoid benefits that make a player just generally stronger.

Examples would be allowing the player to draw extra cards, or just granting them more income, in a game where the only resource is money. If the benefit is too broad, one player just feels generally stronger than another, and continuing the game seems pointless. And, for the stronger player, there's no new strategy created. 

The Radlands card Muse gives you an extra water (the game's basic resource) each turn, so you have 4, not 3. This just leads to the player with Muse playing more stuff. It doesn't matter what it is. The extra volume of stuff will wear the opponent down. They just have a simple, numerical advantage. (Radlands people can be easily killed, especially by a skilled player who knows to kill Muse, so it's not a big problem. I still wouldn't design a card like that these days.)

In Agricola, you start with two family members. This means you can take two turns per round. You can get a third person. That just makes you generally stronger, as you can then get more of everything.

"More turns/actions" is the most general benefit there is, and I recommend avoiding it.

Instead of general strengthening, make a player significantly stronger in one specific way. This means they can still be competed with in other ways. Players who gain power in different areas will all feel like they have a chance, because they're ahead in some way.

Future benefit
Near-future benefit is good for a game. It ties the turns together.

In both Magic and Radlands, you can't use your characters the turn they enter play. You have to wait until your next turn. You don't exactly know what you'll want next turn, so you have to intuit it.

If a benefit is too far in the future, it can become too general, and be stripped of its strategy.

In the Radlands expansion, there was a camp that allowed you to damage something, on your next turn. However, multiple cards would have likely entered and left play by then, so your damage would likely go somewhere you couldn't anticipate. Doing damage was still good, but it could only be evaluated as "a damage" versus its cost, as you didn't know what it was going to hit. It just became a general benefit.

In 7 Wonders, the first round is all about collecting resource and trade cards. However, these are really only important in round three, and somewhat in round 2. Round one is still an interesting puzzle, but it's very self-contained, because you don't know what's coming in later rounds. Rather than build up a big plan, you just collect a variety of resources.

Exploration
The "exploration" mechanic lets you go to an unexplored area of the map, and see what's there. It sounds fun, but why would you actually do it? Even if there are bonuses in there, you don't know what they are. You just have to average them all out, and step into the unknown.

Incidental benefit
An incidental benefit is one that you gain, without choosing to do so. You just gain it when you do something else, or it's an obvious benefit that you might as well gain.

Incidental benefits aren't the result of a strategic choice.

In my gangster game, there's a police cordon that can surround some locations. Being inside the cordon also protects you against the Drive By action, which is on one face of the red die. Players would sometimes go inside the cordon, but protection against Drive By was never the reason why. Drive By was only one face of the red die, so wasn't likely to be rolled. Players would sometimes be protected from Drive By, by the cordon, but it was just an incidental benefit. Drive By was supposed to be a cool effect which players could avoid, by hiding inside the cordon. It turned out to just be a more complicated and random version of regular damage.

I added Drive By to a second face of the red die. Now, it's twice as common, so you can expect a tangible benefit from hiding inside the cordon, which makes moving into the cordon factor into your strategy.

A choice is also not a choice if it doesn't make you change your strategy.

I added "Dens" to my gangster game. You put your den on a location, and every time you go there, you get an extra benefit. The problem is that you go to locations based on what you wanted to achieve. You got the extra bonus from the Den, but it didn't mean anything, or influence your decision.

A very common source of incidental benefit is where an action gives more than one benefit. These extra benefits will usually not factor into the player's strategy. That's fine if you're just trying to balance, but if that extra effect is supposed to be interesting and strategic, then it will fail to be so.

Distinct actions
Some actions don't have consequence because they're they're just a basket of goodies, that don't point to any strategy. They're not distinct from other baskets of goodies, so it doesn't really matter which one they take. They're all general benefit.

In one of my prototypes, players moved to various locations in a town, collecting different types of cards and bonuses. Let's just call them various letters. One would give you ABCD, one would give AABB, one CCDD. In this way, I could make a whole lot of different and interesting combinations, and I could make the benefits match the theme of the location.

I explained the rules to players, and they understood them easily. They went to have their turn, but were immediately bewildered. They had no idea what to do, so they just picked randomly. This continued for many turns. They couldn't parlay this rainbow of options into any kind of concrete strategy, so they just "collected stuff", because more stuff is obviously good, and that's all they could deduce.

Make the options in your game (whether they be cards, board spaces, or any kind of option) as distinct as possible. Give them a distinct purpose, and make them achieve that purpose to a significant degree. Avoid options that grant the player a basket of advantages. One "variety pack" space, with lots of different goodies, is fine though.

A player should be able to see a clear and obvious path to their objective, and take an action that points strongly in that direction.

One of the locations in my prototype was the Karate Hall. You could go there and pick up three Attack cards. This location was unusual, in that it was focussed. It was actually the most useful location in the game. When you decided you wanted to attack someone, you went to the Karate Hall, and got exactly what you needed — Attack cards. After that, all the locations in my game were changed to be like Karate Hall.

A more important feature of distinct options is that they give players control over their strategy. They can easily get the tools they need. The skill is in choosing their grand strategy, not in trying to scrape together and manage incremental amounts of resources to fund it.

Distinct options, which do one thing, might be less interesting on their own, but they make for vastly better gameplay. Actions should only overlap in function, with good reason.

## informationOverload.md
Information Overload
Consider the amount of stuff that's going on, in the game. A player should not have to read ten cards, twenty tiles, and thirty board spaces, in order to understand what's going on.

Keep it Simple
Try to keep visible information to a minimum.

In some complex games, working out what's going on is half the mental challenge. I want the challenge to be the strategy, not comprehending the game.

I once played a Magic knockoff. I drew my first hand of seven cards, and each card had many lines of text. Amongst those many lines of text was even more complexity, as there were jargon words in there, that weren't self-explanatory. Also, the game was cooperative. I needed to read and understand not just the cards in my own hand, but those in the hands of all my teammates as well.

Caverna has a large number of board spaces that players can go to. These are mostly self-explanatory. In addition to this, however, there are 48 building tiles laid out. Better read all of them right at the start of the game, so you don't miss something! Don't worry, though. By your 10th-20th game, you'll have a good grasp of these tiles. There's even a handy "introductory game", with only 27 tiles visible.

Information is much more acceptable when it builds up over time, however. 

Aesthetics
There's also an "ugh" factor, that puts people off, the moment they see the game. If a game looks complicated, people will be less likely to want to play it. And, if it's too late for them to get away, it's feelbadness, before the game has even begun.

A simpler game also just looks nicer.

In my gangster game, I kept increasing the number of location cards on the table, and eventually there were twenty. I needed to do this for gameplay reasons, but it was a serious information overload problem. I decided that the top and bottom five locations would be the same every game. That doesn't help with the first game, but it does afterwards. I colour-coded all location cards by function. I redesigned all locations to be simpler. No location could have more than two icons, or more than one line of text.

Reducing information overload
Half of what your game is communicating should be done with icons, not text.

Even then, your game shouldn't be covered in icons. 

Cards should be simplified, and the player should have the least number of them possible.

Group similar pieces of information together.

A Feast for Odin has 61 different actions a player can take on their turn. However, rows of actions are clumped together, with a label like "Crafting" or "Hunting" next to them.

Try to just have one central board or play space, not different areas of cards and tiles. This isn't possible for all games, but it's a good objective. If you have a card row or a group of tiles that's the centre of the game, that's fine. Things that players don't need to read, like resources, decks, and cards that they can't choose to take, are also fine. They can just sit there, and be ignored.

My farming game had buildings you could purchase. There were about ten of these, on the table. I made them into a deck of cards, and dealt each player two at the start. This was mainly done to add variability, but it got those things off the table.

## interlinking.md
Interlinking
This is important.

I want to talk about what I call "linkages". This is where parts and sub-parts of a game connect to each other in a big web. These are the key to interesting strategy in games. Let me explain.

Examples
If a mechanic is a self-contained mini-game, it can be easily solved by the players, or it's random and no strategy is possible.

An example:

My orc attacks your orc. I roll a die, and if it's higher than your defence, your orc dies.

If you don't interlink, your systems are just self-contained, and either easily solvable, or just totally random. Or, you end up with scissors-paper-rock, prisoner's dilemma, or other known and basic problems. This means the rest of the game has to be that much more strategically interesting, because your boring core isn't pulling any weight. If you can't interlink, then your game probably doesn't have enough systems.

This is the key to creating strategy in games.

You also need to interlink out to something complex, or your puzzle will still be solvable.

Now, let's interlink.

My orc attacks your orc, and kills it. To do this, I must also discard two cards from my hand.

This interlinks combat into the game's card system. It's an interesting trade-off, without an obvious answer. I'd need to know the exact value of the cards, which is probably too complicated to work out.

Another example:

My orc attacks your orc, and kills it. My attacking orc returns back to his home village, in a different part of the board.

This one interlinks combat into the game's spatial system. Maybe you need the orc in this part of the board, and there are other things for him to do. Again, this creates an interesting choice.

Many games revolve around a giant interlink between two systems, and it works. A typical combination is to have one part of the game be spatial, while the other is a competitive resource-gathering area that isn't spatial.

In Agricola, the systems are the competitive central task board, and each player's own farm, which is spatial.

Eight-Minute Empire is a stark example of two interlinking systems. Players simply take a card from the card row on their turn, and follow its instructions. These cards move their armies around a board, or create new armies. Gaining control of the board gets the player points. However, these cards also have a colour, and picking many cards of the same colour awards lots of points at the end of the game. This simple interlink creates an unsolvable problem, and therefore an interesting game. Do I take a card, to help me take over the map, or to try to collect a certain colour?

Biblios is a good game, but it lacks proper interlinking at the start of the game. On your turn, you draw five cards, but one at a time. You choose one to keep, three to give the other players, and one to put into a future auction. The problem here is that the strategy is too simple, and solvable — as you go through the five cards, you just take a good one (or an average one if you're near the end of the five cards.) There's an interlink out to the game's coloured-card collecting system, but you don't have any other cards yet, so that interlink doesn't do anything.

Yahtzee has the same problem, early on. The moves are fairly obvious. However, the rerolling system in Yahtzee has a lot of internal complexity, so it can survive reasonably well without a proper interlink.

Core systems
A properly-functioning core is essentially a mechanic or groups of mechanics that are too complex for the players to completely figure out. The play of the game is the players doing their best to figure this system out, as much as they can.

A core is usually composed of two or more systems, which are interlinked. Some games hide information (such as a hand of cards), creating a statistical calculation that's too complex to solve. One of the systems could be a complex human system, such as psychology, negotiation, or physical dexterity. Interlinking to these will create huge depth.

Scrabble interlinks a spatial system and the dictionary, both of which are highly complex. The result is a game I've been playing for decades

## longTermStrategy.md
Long-term Strategy
Each turn should be a step in a larger plan, not a self-contained puzzle. 

tie turns together
Just as it's important to tie game systems together with interlinking, you should also try to tie turns together, into a bigger, unsolvable game.

You want players intuiting a long-term plan, not just getting the most benefit in a series of self-contained turns.

Permanent benefits make the players plan long-term. This is another benefit of ramps.

Delayed effects of all kinds are also good. Delays might seem strange or bad, but they strongly tie a turn into the following turns.

In Radlands, you can play "event" cards. Each one has a "time" value, and will take that many turns before its effect occurs. Also, when you put a person onto the table, you can't use their ability that turn.

"Money" is almost always a good thing. It should probably be in your game. And, make sure to include some expensive things in your game. Buying something big is also a "big move". Just letting players save up, is a very easy way to tie the turns together.

Anything that lasts beyond the current turn is good.

Sequential actions or a smorgasbord
Multi-stage actions are another way to tie the turns together. If it simply takes multiple turns to put all the pieces together, players must formulate a larger plan.

In Agricola, you just farm crops and animals, to produce food for your people. However, each of those two things is broken down thematically into many steps. To eat crops (efficiently), you need to get a grain token, plow a field, plant the grain in the field, wait for the harvest (whereupon you gain grain), get resources, buy an oven, and then bake the grain into bread. This very sequential gameplay means that you have to do the whole sequence, to gain any benefit. This makes Agricola a much more unforgiving, tense, and strategic game than most games in its category.

Hands of cards
Hands of cards do all kinds of good things, and should be present in most games. They can be great for long-term strategy. Just make sure the cards don't come and go too quickly.

Race for the Galaxy is a great game, but I think it leans a bit too heavily on the tactical side. To play cards, you pay for them by discarding other cards. This too often means that you're discarding your entire hand. This breaks the connection between turns.

You don't want infinite long-term strategy, by making everything too calculable. For most games, a steady drip of a new card per turn keeps this in check.

If you want to make the game have more long-term strategy, turn that drip off, and give players new cards only occasionally.

In Libertalia, players have a hand of nine cards. Each is a pirate ship crew member. Each player plays one of these cards face-down onto the ship, then they're turned over, and they interact, in amusing ways. Many also interact with the characters the player has previously played, which helps tie the turns together even more. New cards are only drawn at the start of each round, which forces a player to plan out all their turns in the round.

## pace.md
Pace
When I play a game, I want to feel like each move achieves something, and that the game is going somewhere, not just repeating itself.

Examples
Make sure the game is changing at least a bit, between a player's turns. You may need to speed your game up to many times its original speed. This is fine. I play far too many incremental games, where nothing ever really changes.

In my city-building game, you gather resources from the board, take them to a building to convert them, then spend the converted resources to buy something. Originally, the game's pace was too slow, because there would usually be two turns of gathering resources, two turns of converting resources, and then a turn to buy something. The two turns of doing the same thing, without any change in the game state, were procedural and boring. I made all the conversion buildings vastly more powerful — seemingly unreasonably powerful — so that players would only need to gather, convert, and build. This was much more fun.

In a prototype I played recently, you fight monsters around a city map. They have 3-5 health points each. On a typical turn, I'd reduce a monster's health by one. It took around five turns just chipping away at one monster, in order to kill it.

In this example, nothing is changing from turn to turn. It takes five turns to achieve something. You might say "But having five monsters with one health is the same as having one monster with five health." No, it's not the same. The five monsters will die off, as they're attacked, thereby changing the board, and they might move, or be in some relevant formation on the board. The player might have to think, move around, and reassess their strategy between fighting them.

Progress
It might seem like this is all relative. How can all moves be made more significant?

Let me make it clearer: each action you take should move you a significant way through some game system. It's not a numerical matter, or a question of balance. It's about giving the player new strength or discovering new stuff each turn. That's fun and rewarding.

In my gangster game, you do damage equal to the number of gang members. This starts at 0, 1, or 2. If you gain gang members, you'll probably gain another 2. That makes you way more lethal to the opponents. There's also "rep" which wins the game when you have 10. You can gain 2 or 3 at once. That's huge progress towards victory.

If a system is just a simple score, and there are a few different scores, then you should probably be able to achieve the maximum in that score with a few actions. If it's a deeper game system, the player could progress through it more slowly.

Adjusting Pace
Think about which part of your game is the best. The start, the middle, or the end? Speed up or slow down your game, so that most of the game is about that part of the game.

In my farming game, players' farms were going crazy near the midpoint, so I slowed the pace down a lot, and now the craziness is right at the end, where it should be. It feels good to achieve abundance, and then the game ends a few turns later.

Supercharging
How fast should your game be? It my opinion, you should blast through all your game's content as fast as possible. If that makes your game half an hour instead of an hour, that's an added bonus!

I call this supercharging. Reduce the cost of everything by half.

At one point, I made the cards in Radlands cheaper. Almost all the cards' costs were reduced to 1. It was shorter, punchier, and more alive.

## playerCount.md
Player Count
A game that supports a larger range of player numbers will appeal to more people, and will more easily get published.

5
Your game should support 2-5 players, if possible. Most games get very slow with five players. If it's a heavier game, just stick to 2-4.

Also consider manufacturing costs. If each player has lots of personal components, a game might top out at four players, instead of five. Four is the minimum for a normal game.

Your game is going to be very hard to playtest if it doesn't work with two players. 2-4 should be your default range, but see if you can add 5.

4
You should support 4 players, unless you have a good reason not to. Getting a game published is harder if it doesn't. I've done it. The most important — and normal — range is 2-4. It's also fine to do just 3-4, if your game has trading or voting, for instance, and doesn't work at 2.

6
6-player games are so slow that they shouldn't be made, without designing the game around them. The game turns should be super-fast, or highly-interactive (such as in a trading game.) Alternatively, they could be team-based, or have simultaneous turns (or no "turns" at all.)

3
Scaling isn't an exact science. The game will be somewhat distorted at different player counts, regardless of what you do.

For standard 2-4 player games, I try to optimise for 3 players, so that 2 and 4-player are both close to the mark.

2
If your game is very adversarial, just make it a two-player game. Don't sacrifice the gameplay, to add players. Two-player-only games are harder to sell, but do what's right for your game regardless. I wouldn't design a game that requires any other specific number of players, however.

I was having significant trouble getting Radlands published, and some publishers were telling me that they weren't interested in a two-player-only game. I added modes for 1 to 4 players, even though it was really a very adversarial two-player game. Roxley liked my game, and agreed to publish it. I brought up the 1-4 player modes I'd added. They said that sometimes it's best for a game to just support the player counts it's intended for. They hadn't done this with their game Santorini, which was really just a two-player game.

I replied "Oh, yeah. I played that game, with three players. Then, I went and rated it 5/10 on BoardGameGeek!"

1
A small number of players will want to play your game solo.

Unless your game is designed for it, I don't think a solo variant is worth your time.

I had some ideas about 1-player rules for Radlands, but never did anything with them. The fans of Radlands came up with solo rules that are probably much better than anything I could throw together. 

Regardless of the player count, design for two-player first, so you can playtest. Then, add more players later on.

## playerInteraction.md
Player Interaction
Games are less interactive than they used to be. This is a good thing. Grinding the other players into dust is not what most players want.

However, some recent games have too little interaction, and each player is really just doing their own little puzzle.

If you can't think of an appropriate way for the players to interact, you can't make the game.

Resource Pools
As far as I'm concerned, there's a minimum level of interaction a game needs. Things like competitive "objectives" are not sufficient, because they don't actually affect the players.

A shared central resource pool is just enough, but players should be able to understand and affect the other players, through this pool. Otherwise, this interaction just randomly affects the other players. I call this "resource pool solitaire". It's like a group of people playing basketball in the same area as people are playing chasey/tag. They bump into each other, and affect each other's games, but not in any intentional way.

In Sagrada, each player builds a pattern out of dice. The player wants to organise the colours and numbers of the dice in certain ways, to get more points. It's very thinky. Each player takes their dice from a central pool, but players have no idea what the other players will take, or why. You just hope no one takes your dice. I like the puzzle, but this level of interaction is too low for me.

In Azul, each player builds a tiled floor out of coloured tiles. These tiles are taken from circular "display" boards in the middle of the table. Players need to think about what tiles other players will take, and take those tiles before anyone else gets them. Also, players won't want to let a big pile of the same-coloured tile build up, because an opponent will likely snaffle them up.

In Agricola, untaken resource tokens simply keep piling up. In general, I'll just focus on my own thing. However, if there's a pile of ten wood tokens on a space, I'll really start thinking about how long I can let it build up, before someone takes it.

Resource pools are acceptable, but they're an easy and overused form of interaction. Try to do something better, or create an interesting resource pool.

Tight card pools
I'm increasingly fond of what I call "tight card pools". This is a very easy way to add high interaction to a card game. If cards are central to a game, I like to have players both draw from, and discard all cards to, a central pool. (Cards may also enter the game from the deck.) This means players have to think about what cards other players will also want, and also think about which cards they discard and hence make available to the other players.

In one of my prototypes, I have a very tight pool. Most cards are drawn from the central pool. This creates a lot of interaction, and also long-term planning, because players need to find a strategy amongst the cards in the pool. 

Safe zones
Even in highly-aggressive games, some things should be off-limits for interaction. I need some kind of area where I can plan things, and not have them destroyed.

Radlands is very confrontational. You're constantly blowing up each other's stuff, in all kinds of ways. I was asked why I didn't put cards into the game that make the opponent discard cards from their hand. I decided that the player's hand would be untouchable, so that the player could properly plan things there, without interference. These plans could then be put to the test on the table, where the real battle occurs. This also stopped the game snowballing. Your opponent always has a way out, because they've got cards in their hand, that you can't touch.

In general, restrict the interaction to one part of the game.

In one of my prototypes, players build a village. I wanted to make the game more interactive, so I added warriors. However, these warriors are only useful in competing for a set of prize cards. These cards are very significant and useful, however. An enemy with lots of warriors can monopolise these prizes, but they can never go beyond that, and come and burn down your village. This gives this game a good amount of interaction, but lets you largely do your own thing, without interference.

Negotiation, trading & auctions
These highly interactive social mechanics provide more than enough interaction, but they have a huge impact on the play and feel of a game. They make a game very political, and less strategic. Do not include them in your game, unless that's what the game is supposed to be about.

## politics.md
Politics
Politics is where things in the game revolve around the players' relationships to each other.

Politics can easily push aside other forms of strategy, as a player's fate is decided arbitrarily by who the other players choose to attack. "I'll use my dragon to destroy… umm…YOU!" It can also lead to unpleasantness, and accusations of unfairness.

Politics can be one of the most feelbad things in board gaming, if applied incorrectly, which it often is. Many games have aggressive, targeted elements thrown in, on top of a non-political game.

To remove politics, you can:

Make the game two-player-only
For very adversarial games, I like this answer best. It enables you to make the game for the player count it's best for, without forcing it to be something else.

Remove the choice of who to attack
In my gangster game, attacks hit all other players.

In my pirate game, you can only attack someone on the same space as you. You could technically travel to any player, but you'd need a logical reason to do so.

Provide a benefit for attacking
Make attacking about theft, not just beating down the opponent.

In my pirate game, you attack someone, in order to steal their cargo. Attacking just to hurt them would be far less satisfying.

Tack on a bonus to attacking, so a player will do it for their own benefit.

It's fine that players can choose who to attack. However, if the decision is completely arbitrary, other players can't plan around it. It's simply random and feelbad. Given the opportunity to attack a player arbitrarily, most experienced gamers will search for a reason to choose who to attack, and avoid accusations of unfairness. Attacking the winning player is the usual convention, as it tends to give the attacker the best chance of winning the game.

For less-civilised gamers, politics is an opportunity to hit someone for non-game reasons. The game devolves into a bizarre and unpleasant social metagame, about who likes who most.

Whatever your solution, it needs to make the choice of who to attack be based on more factors than just the whimsy of the player doing the attacking. Even if a player is the victim of such an attack, they'll be okay with it, as long as there was a good reason they were the target of the attack. Also, they will often be expecting the attack, which allows them to plan around it.

Take that!
As with everything in games, a game should have lots of politics, or none. A game should be about politics, or without politics at all. Do not throw small political elements into a game that's largely not political. However, if players are bashing away at each other all game, and the game is about their relationships to one another, that's fine.

Games about politics tend to be the most basic and inane of all designs. Designers who know nothing about design constantly make "take that" games, where the players just play good cards on themselves, and arbitrarily play bad cards against other players. This is an extremely weak and overused format. Don't do it.

## promotion.md
Promotion & Demotion
Make elements more or less important in your game.

Promotion
Look through the components of your game, for the best bits. Which things are most fun, or strategic?

Add more of them. However, once you start adding these things everywhere, it's probably time to build them into the game at a higher level. Promote them from being objects, to being their own rule/concept/icon.

In Radlands, cards were initially all just in a row. It didn't matter where you put them. However, I made a Watchman card. He could be placed in front of another card, and the opponent would have to attack him, before they could attack the card behind him. This turned out to be such an interesting ability that I made more such cards that could protect a card behind them. I called this ability "protection". Eventually, I gave so many cards this protection ability, that I promoted protection to be a game rule — every person could protect.

In my gangster game, there are four different-coloured dice you can roll. I made a few locations that allow you to roll two specific dice, see what you roll, and then choose which one of those two rolls you want to enact. Choosing between two die faces on different dice is a very interesting decision, despite it being such a simple concept. I really liked these locations, but there were only six of them — one for each different pair of dice. I decided to promote this "roll two dice and choose one of the rolls" to an icon. It's now a die, split down the middle, with each half being a different colour. Because this is now just a simple icon, I can pair it with other effects, or have two of them on a location. This lets me use this cool effect on a huge number of the game's locations. (I then tried promoting it again, such that all die rolls are these "choice" rolls, but that was too much.)

In my gangster game, I created numerous cards that placed money or health tokens on various locations. Each of these cards had to specify that whoever went to that location got the tokens. Eventually, I just added this as part of the rules, and my cards got a whole lot simpler.

In my gangster game, there are criminal "profiles", that give you a special ability. There are many of these, and you play as one each game. However, there are special power cards that are available in every game. These are important, and I wanted some more of them. I took some of the coolest profiles, and promoted them to power cards. Now, those cool things are in every game.

Demotion
Demotion is the opposite. However, sometimes you have a fun rule, but the game just doesn't need it. Rather than abolishing it, you can just demote it back into a game element, like a card.

In Radlands, you could pay one water resource to rearrange all your people into a new formation. It was an interesting rule, but players rarely used it. The rule was demoted back to being a single, interesting card, called High Ground.

Also, if an effect becomes too rare, it should be demoted.

Radlands had three damage icons — "damage anything", "damage a person", and "damage a camp". After some changes, the camp-damaging icon was present on only two or three cards. I removed it from those cards, and just replaced it with the regular damage icon plus the text "...a camp".

## ramps.md
Ramps
A ramp is where the game builds up in some way, as it progresses.

Ramping up
In some games, the activity is complex and interesting enough to be repeated. That's fine. However, most games should ramp up.

If a game doesn't have a ramp, it should probably be a short game. Many of my games are rampless — they just get straight to the action, stay there for a short while, and then end. However, I'd generally recommend having your game ramp up. It's a tried-and-tested approach, and is much easier to execute than a non-ramping game.

Scrabble doesn't have a ramp. In Scrabble, players just repeat the same activity, until the game ends.

In Magic, players play a land card on each of their turns. As the players have more and more lands, they can play bigger and bigger spells.

Ramps are good
Players like going up ramps — building or strengthening or adding to their presence in the game. It's fun and creative, and ties into people's constructive instincts. Players feel like they're making progress.

A ramp progresses the game to its end. More importantly, it keeps the game changing, and it keeps outdoing itself, with bigger and cooler stuff.

It might be tempting to think "this is just going to snowball, and one player will get out of control." Yes, but that's the fun. Seeing whose game can snowball the fastest. Don't make it too simple, of course.

A proper game should have multiple ramps. If there's only one ramp, it's obvious who's going to win, and it's too simple. Give each resource or system its own ramp.

Ramp trajectory
Your ramp should be steep. The bigger the ramp, the better, within reason. Your game should begin with the smallest possible actions, and eventually reach actions that almost break the game. Then, it should end.

At the beginning of the game, a player is weak, and weighed down with restrictions. Through the game, the player gains strength, and overcomes these restrictions. This isn't just good for the game. It's fun and rewarding.

Avoid having your ramp be reversible. It's okay that some things are reversible (such as resources, money, health etc.), but at least one important thing should just go constantly upward.

## randomness.md
Randomness
This topic is covered unusually well by other sites, but I'll cover it here, briefly.

Uncertainty
If things are too predictable, players can simply solve your game. That's no fun. Things should be somewhat uncertain.

A good designer adds uncertainty, by using interlinking, hidden information, by and adding interaction between components or players. This makes the game too strategically complex for the players to solve. A player is not entirely certain what they should do, so they need to think about it.

A bad designer just throws in randomness, to create the uncertainty. It does the job, but with a host of downsides — it's often feelbad, disruptive, and anti-meritocratic.

If you're looking for a way to resolve combat or some other small test, use hidden information, not just randomness. If I attack you, I don't roll a die. Instead, you may play a shield card from your hand.

You want players to have some ability to deduce or reason what's going to happen — not total ability or inability.

Input / output randomness
Input randomness gives people randomness, but then lets them do something with it. The most common kind is simply drawing cards. You get random cards, but then you get to use them as you wish, and they have their non-random effect. This allows the player to strategise, and do meaningful things.

Output randomness means that you make your choice, and then the randomness occurs.

In Monopoly, a player draws a card, and something happens immediately. There is no strategy, just random surprise.

Using output randomness
You can use output randomness, but try to remove "bad" outcomes. The best output randomness gives different and interesting results, not good and bad results.

In one of my prototypes, there was very clear output randomness. You could try to use a skill, like Climbing. You'd roll a die and add your Climbing skill score. If the total was high enough, you succeeded. However, if you "failed", you learned from it, and your Climbing skill score increased by one.

Multiple playtesters of the Radlands expansion submitted the "crazy hospital" card idea. This thing might heal your person, or it might kill them. Wacky! This output randomness was really un-fun to play, and out of place in Radlands. I eventually made a version which healed your person if successful, but gave you a refund, and turned your injured person into a punk, if it failed. Punks are okay, so everyone was happy to try out this card, because there was no real downside.

If some results are better, make one or two outcomes stand out by being good, while the rest are mediocre. Don't have any "clearly bad" outcomes.

Even if you have good and bad results, avoid making them "strictly worse" results. This is where one result is equal or better in every way. Three goats might usually be better than two sheep, but three goats is strictly (always) better than two goats.

Randomness is useful
Randomness has some very positive attributes, and most games can benefit from a small amount of it.

Randomness makes each game different.

Chess starts out exactly the same each time, which is less interesting, and allows players to memorise opening sequences.

Randomness means a weaker player has a chance of beating a better player. This means that every game is a serious competition.

I'm an excellent Scrabble player, but anyone could beat me.

Randomness is exciting. Randomness is generally maligned in strategy games, but some games are about the surprise and excitement of randomness. For fun and light-hearted games, randomness is entirely appropriate. Also, if there's constant randomness, it tends to even out.

## reducingComplexity.md
Reducing Complexity
Half of game design is game design, and the other half is simplification.

Reducing complexity is one of the hardest and most important parts of game design. It's something that needs to be done to almost every game prototype I see.

Your game is probably three times more complex than it should be. That's been my experience, from the game prototypes I've seen.

Make things work the same way
Avoid adding new systems. Instead, try to create more things within your existing systems.

My games tend to consist of very few systems, but with many things packed into those systems. I then have a reminder sheet that explains what those things are.

In my farm game, there are no separate rules for different things. Everything is just a token you can put on your land. At the end of each round, each token does an effect of some sort. Within that system, I could create pretty much anything. There used to be "lords" who would come to stay. I made them just another token on your farm, and their effect was that you could feed them, and get points. There were invasive bandits, too. They were another token, and their effect was that they'd take over some land.

In my gangster game, you go somewhere, and enact the icons printed on that location. The reminder sheet has a big list of what all the icons mean.

Radlands doesn't have a "combat system". It has abilities, and some of those abilities attack the opponent's stuff. So, combat exists, but as part of the ability system.

In another prototype, cards were the system. You could play cards that did all kinds of stuff. You could attack people too, but that was just another card you could play.

After compacting most of my game into one system, I then try to make those individual things each as simple as possible, or cull those that can't be simplified.

Find things in your game that work in similar ways, and make them work the same way, as part of the same system.

A Feast For Odin has 61 action spaces on the board, for players to choose from. This is an enormous amount, and far too many for most games. However, board complexity is greatly reduced by the fact that almost all the spaces work in just a few ways — largely giving out or converting resources.

the process
I don't worry about the complexity of individual components too much at the start of my design process. It's towards the end of the process that I apply a "bar". It's not a mathematical equation, but every rule and part of the game must add a certain amount of gameplay, per unit of complexity. This causes me to redesign and reword many things, and cut others. This bar gradually creeps up, and by the end of the design, almost everything is simple, and some things are gone.

You want to go over every single thing with a fine-tooth comb, asking "can I possibly remove this text/icon/concept/rule?" You can usually make something half as complex, but 90% as good.

Get rid of anything that creates an exception to the normal rules, unless you have lots of worthwhile things creating the same exception, in which case you should probably turn it into a rule.

Don't add rules 
Never add a rule, in order to fix a problem.

This is a well-known piece of advice.

Instead, create components within your existing rules, that fix your problems.

Radlands had an issue that the game would snowball in the winning player's favour, with one player having a group of people in play that would wipe out the opponent's people, and leave them unable to recover. Rather than add rules to deal with this, I added the cards Radiation and Famine, which kill most of the people on the table.

In one of my prototypes, it was common for players to amass too many cards. Rather than create a rule that set a limit, I just added a little ability on a couple of cards, which forces players with very large numbers of cards to discard some of them. After that, players avoided building up too many cards.

## relateability.md
Relatability
Relatability is where something in your game evokes something the player is already familiar with.

The player can relate to the item, event, or character, and they can feel like they're really in the story.

Familiarity
People don't actually want something new. They want to experience something they already like, but in a board game.

You convert the theme into a board game, and maybe put your own twist on it, but it's still that familiar thing.

Radlands was rethemed to post-apocalyptic. Most people love that theme. Now, they can be part of such a world.

You might say that your newfangled and unique theme is actually really good, and it will resonate strongly with the players. That's great, but are you actually going to be able to convey it? Players aren't going to read some irrelevant story from the rulebook. All you have is your artwork and names, and they have to convey the theme alone. It's really hard to teach players a whole new lore with just art and card names. They'll just see random names and artwork, and ignore it.

Magic's card sets strongly evoke things you already know — stories, themes, countries, and real history. How about ancient Japan world, with ninjas? How about an Indiana Jones type of adventure world? How about a world based on children's fairytales?

Tap into lore the players already know and love.

The Radlands expansion had a card called "bivouac". Unfortunatelly, half my playtesters didn't know that word. Some even thought it was "bio-vac". It had to change.
Known things
Your game objects should represent things the player already knows. You give a card or object a relatable name (and later, the publisher does matching artwork.)

However, this is only half the picture. The object has to actually behave like the real thing in the play of the game. The mechanics must match the theme/name of the object.

Radlands is full of such cards. There's Wounded Soldier — an excellent warrior, who starts out damaged, and you have to heal him, if you want to use him. Cult Leader sends your other people off to their doom, to destroy the opponent's stuff. Catapult lets you hurl your own people. In game terms, it destroys one of your people, and can hit anything. This matches the theme closely.

Connecting theme and function is key to immersive gameplay. If you can't do this, because your game rules are too simple, it means you need a smaller and less pretentious theme.

Also, a relatable card or item isn't just cool, it also helps people understand gameplay. A new player might be introduced to a lot of new things, but if those things work in obvious ways, it will be much easier for them to remember. An axe that cuts down trees, and gains you wood, is relatable. The Charm of Kroznor that swaps two resources for one other resource, is not relatable. (Be careful not to get it mixed up with the Charm of Grozbat, which rearranges the top four cards of the deck!) 

Names
I don't like creative names.

Radlands uses very simple names, like Scientist, Exterminator, Holdout, Sniper, Arena, and Blood Bank. These names all tie in closely to the actual function of the cards.

Some names have to be strange, because there's no simple and good name that matches the function of the card (or other game object).

However, my policy is that as many names as possible should be a "real thing". This could mean something that exists in the real world (like Catburglar, Mosh Pit, or Flamethrower.) This could also mean a known fictional thing (like Portal, Time Travel, or Magic Wand.)

If it's two words, they should be a known phrase, not simply adjective-noun. (Rabid Dog and Fuel Tanker are good. Silver Axe and Immortal Angel are not.)

Give all your cards (or other pieces) relatable names, but also work backwards from the theme. Come up with the best-known and most thematic characters, items and events, from the theme of your game. Then, make cards from them.

Magic made sets of cards set in a gothic horror world. They filled these sets with cards designed backwards from the theme. The set was full of relatable cards like Bump in the Night, Cellar Door, Boarded Windows, and Jar of Eyeballs. They introduced double-sided cards, so that some townsfolk cards could "flip over" to a werewolf side at night.

A useable theme
Most things in your game should be entities: people (or other characters), places, and objects. These categories are categories full of well-known and relatable things. You can certainly use actions, events, and concepts as well, but they're much harder to make relatable and different, than entities are.

In Lords of Waterdeep, you gather adventurers, and complete quests. These quests are unrelatable nonsense like "Protect the House of Wonder" and "Establish Harper Safe House". I would've themed these to be different monsters that you fight, not "quests".

In my gangster game, I gave each player a "Big Dreams" card, which was a unique and expensive thing that only they could do. I later changed this to each player having a "criminal profile". They could be a catburglar, a biker, a scientist etc. These were people, and they were much more relatable.

I've played many game prototypes about elemental magic duels. Everything is some variety of abstract spell of some sort, and it's all meaningless.

In Star Realms and Space Base, the cards are spaceships. Each card's theme only loosely relates to its mechanics. They have no character, and they all seem similar.

Wingspan is a hugely successful game about birds. However, it's just a pretty theme. It's almost impossible to connect hundreds of different birds to their abilities. What's a Canvasback anyway? (Seemingly some kind of duck.) And why is its ability "all players draw a card?"

When and Where?
If your game is about people and places, those people and places come from some place and time.

The real world is where you'll get the most relatable stuff. However, the real world is fairly limiting.

My gangster game fits perfectly into the real world. It uses so many real life places, and gangster tropes. It's my most relatable game.

Sci-fi is probably my next choice. It sacrifices some relatability, but isn't limiting.

Early on, there was a suggestion that Radlands could be WW2-themed. But how could I make dozens of clearly-different cards in such a world? The Mad Max post-apocalyptic theme was also suggested, and I enthusiastically endorsed it. This sub-genre of sci-fi does violence and destruction very well, and I could throw in wacky science to handle the rest.

Fantasy works, but is massively overused. Fantasy is also fairly unrelatable, except for its historical component, and all the stuff that's been used forever, like orcs and dragons.

Historical settings are a very restrictive version of the present, and are only occasionally appropriate. You would usually want to start with this theme, and build the game around it.

## replayability.md
Replayability
How many times is someone going to want to play your game?

You've made a great game, but can you do something to the game, to have it be playable almost endlessly?

Difference
The answer to this question lies in how different each game will be. Some games have relatively simple concepts, that create fairly deep strategy (Chess, for example.) Others are just wildly different each time, because there are so many possibilities. The tile-laying game Carcassonne, for instance.

Others get a bit samey. For those games, you'll want to add a mechanic that makes each game different. Not so different that it doesn't feel like the same game. Just different enough that the player has to rethink their strategy.

Variable Setup
The best way to do this is usually to vary the setup of the game, while leaving the objective and rules of the game the same.

Agricola's "family version" is one example. It's a great game, but after a few plays, I'm doing basically the same stuff — growing crops and/or breeding animals. And here's where Agricola shines: In the full version of the game, each player begins the game with a hand of cards that affect how the game works. For instance, the Berry Picker gives me a free Food whenever I take Wood. Even a few simple cards like this warp the game enough that I need to rethink my strategy every game.

Variable player powers & objectives
This is a common mechanic, where each player has a unique rule, bonus, or objective for the game. "This time, you're the Romans", or "This time, you're the Doctor." These add replayability, but only as much replayability as there are different powers. A game with six different player powers just lets players play six different ways, and no more.

Multiple variable factors
The key to adding replayability is to have multiple factors that vary. Consider "this game you're the doctor, and your super-power is... invisibility!" Each of the variable factors makes a small change to the game, but there are many combinations of factors, that will interact in countless ways.

In Santorini, players move around a 5x5 grid, building towers, piece by piece. The objective is to climb to the top of a tower. To add replayability, there's a deck of dozens of Greek gods. Each player is dealt one at the start of the game, and these cards make a significant change to how the player plays the game. These are interesting and impactful variable player powers, that affect movement, building, interaction with the opponent, and much more. Because each player has a god card, and they interact with each other through the gameplay, the game actually does have multiple variable factors. The god Pan is the same every game, but his strategy against Ares is vastly different than if he's against Demeter. This interaction creates endless replayability.

I know Dominion's cards like the back of my hand, but I still play it. Each game, there are ten different types of cards for sale. This would get boring after a few games, except that the ten types of cards are selected from amongst dozens. Even if only one card were different, the strategy for that game would likely be completely changed.

One source of variability
Despite having multiple variable factors, these should all be limited to one part of the game. For instance, a player could have two different character cards each game, but not one variable card, and a variable board. People want to play the same game again, not have a totally different and unfamiliar experience.

Extra variability should only be added when a game is clearly lacking replayability. Some designers seem to just throw variable setups and powers into every game they make. Only add variability if the game needs it.

Nudge the players
If you provide multiple different paths to victory, the player shouldn't just choose one arbitrarily each game. Some games have many paths, but there's no reason for a player to choose a different one, other than the fact that they haven't tried it before.

If your game has some kind of mini-objective, or some other thing that isn't a player power, give each player one or two to begin the game with, to give them a nudge in a new direction.

Failure to be different 
If your game doesn't have a setup that's variable enough, people will quickly work out the optimal early moves. They'll discuss them, and anyone who reads it won't want to play your game any more.

The game Tzolk'in has only a slight variation in starting resources, and nothing else. Now, almost all players start with one specific series of opening moves.

As much as I'm in favour of replayability, it's not as important as the actual gameplay. Making your game worse, to allow it to be played more times, is self-defeating. Some games are correct to have limited replayability. I'd rather have an 8/10 game that's playable ten times, than a 7/10 game that's playable a hundred times. I can just play the game ten times, and then play something else.

## resources.md
Resources
We've all played the game where a building costs 8 Wood and 4 Stone to build. Even the classic computer game Starcraft had two costs — minerals, and vespene gas. Why?

Having these two separate resources doesn't really achieve anything, except making things a bit more complex to afford.

Resource identity
Each resource should have its own fundamental identity, tied to its own system or important game concept.

In our wood and stone example, maybe wood buildings produce resources, while stone buildings are worth points. This actually means something now. As a player, I don't just want to get more resources. I want specific resources, depending on what I want to do. If you have resources that aren't fundamentally different, you should probably merge them. Even in this example, wood and stone are fundamentally both just different building resources. This would be fine, if building buildings was the central part of the game, and each one of those two resources could be given an individual identity within that.

Unless a game is about resource conversion, no resource should be easily and repeatably convertible to another resource.

"Block" is a common score I see in combat games. It reduces damage. Yes, it's different to some kind of damage score, in that it's defensive, but it's so clearly equivalent to the attack score, because both are part of the game's combat system. Also, it's boring. 

In my gangster game, there are four clearly distinct resources. There's health, which keeps you alive, and in the game. There's money, which buys entry into powerful places. There's rep, which wins the game if you get 10, and there are gang members, which cause you to do more damage to opponents. You could argue that your health and the opponents' gang members are related concepts, but they're not that close. The resources in this game all correspond to different systems and concepts.

Wingspan is a great game, but it has its flaws. Some bird cards will let you tuck cards underneath them. Others let you put food tokens on them. However, tucked cards and food tokens are all simply worth one point. These two systems are usually identical. I would've made the placed food tokens usable by lots of other birds, or have some rule difference. Or, I would've just abolished the tucking of cards, and just used tokens some more.

In my farming game, stone is for buying buildings, wood is for expanding your land, food is the general resource, and gold is a special resource that allows you to use a taken space.

## scaling.md
Scaling
Scaling is the process by which you make your game work properly (and hopefully well), regardless of how many people are playing.

A map which is suited to five players, might be too big when the game is played with two. With more players, there might not be enough resources in play for everyone to get enough. In a cooperative game with more players, the game objective might be too easy.

Fixing the problems
It doesn't matter if the game plays differently at different player counts, as long as it's still good.

Doing nothing (or just a little bit) can be a very acceptable solution to scaling issues. The best scaling is no scaling at all. Some games can simply be played perfectly well with different player counts, with no special rules.

Boards
If your game has a board, a basic solution is two have a two-sided board — one for 2-3 players, and one for 4+ players.

You can also have your board be in pieces, and flip some of them, based on player count.

The boards in Caverna are cut up into slivers. You flip or remove some of them. There's a combination of board slivers for every player count from 2-7.

Cards
If your game has cards, having to fish through the game's decks, to remove all the cards for other player counts is onerous. If you have to alter the decks, just make it a very small number of impactful cards being added or removed.

As an alternative, you can simply add special text to cards, such that they do something extra or different, if you're in a game with a specific number of players. These are best in games that have "event cards", where a bit of extra text is okay, and the card affects everyone. These variable cards require extra words, but they don't require extra components, or that the players sift through the cards before each game.

Numerically scaling abilities
Overt scaling abilities that say something like "gain wood tokens equal to the number of players" can work, but are a bit "dirty laundry".

In my gangster game, players attack all their opponents simultaneously, by rolling custom dice. In a 5-player game, you have four other people attacking you, and this gets lethal too quickly. I made two faces of the red die a "grenade" ability. This ability causes opponents to lose 1 health if there are 4-5 players, 2 health if there are 3 players, and 3 health if there are 2 players. This was a very easy way to scale the game. The games with more players are still more lethal, but it's still reasonable.

Game length
The game length shouldn't necessarily be multiplied by having more players. Two hours is fine for a two-player game, but players will simply not play the game with five players if it's going to take five hours. You need to drastically cut back the game end condition, or number of rounds, even if it impacts the game.

If a game ends when its components run out, that can be a great way to scale the game length. Just use the same number of components, regardless of player count.

## simplicity.md
the Simplest Way
For any problem, always start with the simplest solution.

An example
A friend's game involves the players fighting a monster that roams the city. This monster is controlled by a deck of cards that move it, and cause it to attack. Each turn, the players draw a card, and follow its instructions.

You might imagine all kinds of cool things to put on these cards. The monster might move different combinations of two directions. It might change direction when it hits a wall. It might move, then also destroy stuff or attack. None of this is necessary. This is all just complication and work for the players, and it adds nothing to the gameplay.

The monster just needs to function properly, so the players can combat it. It can be a rampaging and mindless Godzilla. It doesn't need to be some super-strategic ninja, whose antics occupy half the game time.

The correct answer here is the simplest one. The cards should just say "The monster moves one space west" or "Everyone on or adjacent the monster loses 2 health."

You then design the rest of the game to work with this simplicity, rather than using complexity to solve problems. If the monster isn't doing enough damage, because it's not attacking enough, you increase its damage. If you're annoyed that it hits the edge of the map, you just add an occasional "teleport back to the middle" card, so that wall-hitting is rare.

A bad designer simply lets out their belt, and adds complexity.

Avoid creating rules
The rulebooks for my games tend to be about one or two pages long. This is because I avoid creating rules. People are surprised by how simple the rules of my games are.

Simple rules let players start playing immediately. They can devote their intellect to formulating a strategy, rather than to wrapping their head around the rules. It's just a much nicer experience to play something simple.

Avoid creating rules for certain conditions and times.

Imagine you're creating a dungeon-exploring game. What if there are no monsters left in the dungeon? You might create a rule that adds a monster. What if too many monsters end up on one space? You might create a rule that separates them, or a rule that says they can't go onto the same space. A great designer deals with these problems without rules. They construct the game in such a way that these problems never happen. I can't tell you how to do this, only that you must do it.

## spatialSystem.md
Spatial Systems
Spatial systems are usually boards made of spaces or squares, that players move pieces around. However, there are many degrees of spatial systems.

What is a Spatial System?
A spatial system is actually a repeated pattern of relationships between all the spaces on the board. This creates enormous intricacy in the game, but it's also easy to understand, as players easily understand which spaces are adjacent. This means spatial systems have an extraordinary Depth:Complexity ratio.

Chess, Go, and Scrabble are games that players can spend a lifetime playing. It's no coincidence that they all have a spatial system.

Beware
Many designers (myself included) instinctively try to represent our theme as it is in the real world — a spatial environment. 

However, spatial systems have profound consequences for a game. This includes a plethora of hidden downsides. I've fallen into many of the traps created by using a spatial system, that I simply didn't understand at the time.

You should ask yourself if your game could possibly work without a spatial system. It might sound strange to abstract physical space away like this, but I strongly recommend you do it.

When Through the Ages was released, it was touted as being "just like the computer game Civilization... but without a map". I was as incredulous as anyone, but it really does work.

Spatial systems typically require a board, and pieces, which adds significantly to a game's component costs. Spatial systems can also add vast rules complexity and information overload.

1D Spatial systems
If you do want to use a spatial system, consider using a simpler spatial system, such as 1D (a line or loop), rather than a full 2D one. A 1D spatial system is still a significant game component.

Radlands has a fairly simple spatial system. You play cards into the table. These are in a grid of nine. The location of the columns doesn't matter, but in each column, the cards in front protect the cards behind. It's three very small 1D spatial systems.

A very common 1D system is the "card row". Players can buy cards from the card row, but the cost of a card is determined by its position in the row. The cards at the start of the row are cheap or free, while those at the top are most expensive. When a card is bought, everything above it moves down, and a new card is added to the end. This keeps the prices of cards moving, so players constantly have to evaluate when a card is cheap enough to buy.

In Boss Monster, players build a 1D dungeon. It's a line of Room cards. The enemy attacks the dungeon, starting at one end, and progresses through the rooms in order (and hopefully not right to the end.)

2D spatial systems: Movement
A 2D spatial system is just a grid (or other pattern) as in Cluedo or Scrabble.

Most 2D games involve movement, where one or many agents move around the board.

In many 2D movement games, access is too limited, and the game is extremely slow. This problem is worst when a player has a single "character" or other piece, that moves around the board. I've seen designers avoid this problem, by increasing players' movement speed across the board. However, this often means that the player can access lots of things, but makes the spatial nature of the board irrelevant, as the player can reach almost any location they like.

In one of my prototypes, players realistically moved around a town full of interesting and thematic spaces. They could move a few spaces at once.

I never understood why this game wasn't good, but later, I realised the spatial system had crippled the players' access. They couldn't do what they wanted. Despite it being very thematic and interesting, the spatial board was just serving as a way to greatly limit the players' ability to do things.

This system also reduced the pace of the game to a crawl. Players wanted to do something, but had to spend four turns walking across the board, to get there.

You will likely also need to include rules for "range" in your game. Even if done simply, this can be complex, and create work. I suggest "range" be limited to two spaces away, if you must have it. Anything more, and players can't work it out easily enough.

To create proper access on a 2D board, you can simply have a large number of agents per player. War games tend to do this.

Of course, you can have a very small board.

In Santorini, the board is only 5x5, and each player has two movable workers.

Even with multiple movable agents, they'll likely need to start very spread out, or the game will begin with five turns of "going for a walk".

Chess, with sixteen pieces per player, has significant access limitation at the start of the game, but this phase is brief, and consequential. 

Incentivise movement
Give the players a reason to move around the board. I want to have to survey the board, and factor my location into my plans. That's interesting. 

I've played many prototypes where I just move to the enemy, and then stay there, thus making the spatial system irrelevant.

Harder still, you want the player to keep moving around the board. Why won't they just stay in one spot? What stops them using a particular area repeatedly? These are hard problems.

2D spatial systems: Placement
Placement is a much safer way to use a 2D board. This means placing more and more pieces onto the board, rather than moving them around.

In Blokus, players place Tetris-shaped pieces on a grid, but they can (and must) connect each subsequent piece to the corner of a piece they placed previously. The player who gets rid of the most pieces before the board clogs up, is the winner. Blokus uses a full 2D system, but is a very light game.

Placement only makes thematic sense for a minority of themes, but it's vastly easier to design around, mechanically. It also tends to have very good access.

Placement allows full access to the board, and it doesn't require (often complex) movement or range rules. The shapes and spatial relationships formed by these pieces can be made to matter, and can be the core of the game. Fitting jigsaw pieces together can be fun.

There are some great medium-light games that combine object placement with a simple scoring system.

2D placement is also a kind of accumulation, which is good for games.

Stay away
If you have a 2D spatial system, then the game is about your spatial system. Don't consider it to be some minor feature.

I strongly suggest almost everyone avoid spatial movement systems.

My attempts have all failed, and I've been designing games for many years. If you have to make a "map" or landscape as your board, don't make it spatial. Just let the player go anywhere on their turn.

Ways to MAke Spatial Movement Work
You give the player their own tableau of options, or lots of cards. They have plenty of things to do, and their position on the board is of very low importance. This makes for a strange kind of a game, but it can work. I call this the travelling musician — he can play his music wherever he is.

In Clank! in Space, you move around a spaceship. However, there are only a few types of rooms. This means you can probably get to the kind of room you're looking for fairly easily. The whole game arc is a voyage into the depths of the ship, and then out again, which forces players to keep moving. The focus of the game is the deck-builder part. After you move, you buy new cards for your deck. This is completely unrelated to where you are in the spaceship. All together, this makes this 2d movement game work.

## tension.md
Tension
Tension is where the game is at a crucial moment, and there is much to be gained or lost. Every move matters. This makes for very exciting games, if done correctly.

For there to be tension, there must be risk of loss (or of missing out on something great.) But how severe should this loss be? It shouldn't be "who cares?", nor should it be "I'm doomed." If the player suffers this loss, or misses out, they should have to change their strategy, to deal with it. That's my preferred amount of tension.

In train route-building game Ticket to Ride, you're collecting cards, in order to build routes. However, in many places, only one player can build a route. Another player could build there before you, at any moment. If that happens, you'll have to take a longer path. This is a good level of tension.

You probably don't want your game to be too cutthroat.

Agricola and Caverna are both best-selling farm-building games. In Agricola, there is a sequence of steps you need to take, in order to prepare for each of the regular harvest phases, so you get enough food. Get it wrong, and your people will starve, and you've probably lost the game. It's very tense.

In Caverna, there isn't really a sequence of steps, that could go wrong. You can just get stuff to eat. If someone takes it, you can get something else. You don't need to cook things, so you can't be left with inedible food. Most people prefer the low-tension Caverna.

CLIFFHANGERS
In adversarial games, make the players extremely vulnerable.

In my gangster game, players battle to the death. Originally, players started on ten health points. They'd casually attack each other for a while, reducing each others' health, but it didn't really matter. However, once players got to five health or below, they could die at any time. A cliffhanger battle ensued, as players desperately tried to save their last few points of health.

I changed the rules. Players now start the game on half as much health. You can literally be eliminated after one turn. Choose your move carefully. That's what I call tension!

In Radlands, the cards are so destructive that you can be half-destroyed in one turn. You must race to deal with the opponent's people immediately, or they'll ruin you.

Competition
In competitive games, make only one bundle of each resource available.

If someone takes a resource, it should mean that other players should have to wait to get that resource again, or they should get much less of it.

In most worker-placement games, if someone takes what you want, you'll have to wait for the next round, when their worker leaves, so you can take it. I wanted my farming game to have much more tension than other games in its genre. In my game, the workers never leave. When someone takes the horse, or the cabbage, no one else can ever get them again.

Deadlines
Keep constant time pressure on the players. Add in deadlines. This can be an impending punishment if they don't achieve something, or an opportunity that can be seized.

In my farm game, the players had objective cards, which would award points if completed by the end of the game. This wasn't very tense, so I let the players complete them at the end of any round, for vastly increased points. Now, the players are always rushing to try to complete their objectives before the end of the round.

## terminology.md
Terminology
Use simple language and terminology. You're just trying to help players understand the game.

Remember that even when you use simple terminology and wording, people will still fail to understand things. They'll assume things work in ways that would be clearly overpowered, they'll imagine rules that aren't there, and they'll sometimes just fail to read sentences. Don't make this even worse, by using complex wording and terminology.

The Radlands camp Reactor says it "destroys all people". I get people regularly asking if "all" is both players' people, or if it's just the opponent's people.

Words not to use
Do not use jargon for existing concepts that have an ordinary English word for them. Your deck is just a deck of cards, no matter how much you try to spice it up, by calling it the "archive", "spell book", or "army".

Create jargon when you create a new entity, such as a second deck. However, your jargon should be minimally creative. Its overwhelming objective should be that the greatest number of people correctly understand it. Use whatever word fits that objective best. Tell people a concept, and then ask them what they'd call it.

I like to use neutral terms like location, person/character and board wherever possible. This is even more important when you have varying types of that thing. I don't want to have to remember which guys are "allies", which are "mercenaries" and which are "heroes".

However, you should avoid using known concepts, from classic games. This includes words like joker, wild, and run. These are themeless and immersion-breaking, reminding the player that they're actually just moving bits around, and not participating in an exciting world.

In Egypt-themed Egizia, there's a worker with a white skirt. He's the only worker that can add his strength to another worker. The game calls him the "joker". When I teach people the game, I call him the "helper". It's far more explanatory, and is thematic.

My publisher renamed Radlands' locations to Camps, and citizens to Punks. These added theme, while not being confusable.

Do not include Magic terminology like target (something of your choice), resolve (happen), or Dungeons & Dragons terms like 3d6 (three six-sided dice.) Don't say things like "active player" or "orthogonal" (adjacent, but not diagonally.) Game enthusiasts know these terms. No one else does.

Remember that things like resolve (happen), search your deck, and reveal a card, are unknown concepts to many people.

Many things don't need a name
I avoid the terms supply and bank to refer to unused tokens or resources. People don't need to be told that unused pieces should just sit in a pile on the table, and they know that when they gain something, they get it from that pile (not from another player, for instance.)

Do not create a named "zone" for everything, that you refer to, and that players will need to remember. Things can just be "in play" or "on the table" instead of "in the battle zone". Cards on the table, but not in play, can just be "set aside".

Just because Magic calls your deck the library, and your discard pile the graveyard, it doesn't mean you should. Magic is a game with a huge amount of depth and complexity.
Language
As with jargon, the phraseology you use (typically on cards) should simply be that which conveys the correct meaning to the most people.

The Magic card Dead Ringers reads "Destroy two target nonblack creatures unless either one is a color the other isn't." Basically, the two creatures have to be exactly the same colour or combination of colours, and not black. This card is legendary for its incomprehensibility.

You do not get any extra points for being technically correct. Only huge games like Magic need exact terminology, because they have complicated rules, and are always creating new cards.

The Radlands card "Looter" has the damage icon, and then it says "if this hits a camp, draw a card." The word "hit" isn't defined anywhere in the game, but it's obvious what it means. Replacing it with several technically-correct words would be ugly, and cause a small number of players to not understand it.

You can be very conversational in the language you use on your cards, as long as people know what you mean. You can also be redundant.

A camp in Radlands once had the text "You can only use this ability in a turn in which you play no other abilities." Basically, it must be the only ability you use in a turn.

If you analyse it, there are temporal problems with this strange wording. When you use it, you don't technically know whether it's valid to use it or not, as you're not yet sure whether you'll use another ability later in the turn. Technically, the card's text should tell you that you can only use it if you haven't played any abilities this turn, and it should prevent you from using any further abilities this turn. Despite this technical error, everyone understood the card. There was never a problem.

If anyone is failing to understand something, it's your problem.

It's fine to put explanatory text on cards. Just some small, grey text, that people don't have to read, but that people can refer to if they get confused.

Rules Depth
Do not cater to rules pedants, by adding extra text to your cards to make them exactly accurate. Cater to the 99% of reasonable people. I answer Radlands questions all the time, where the answer is obvious, but it would be possible to interpret them diferently.

There's a Radlands camp called Catapult. You destroy one of your own people, and damage one of the opponent's cards. The art shows Catapult hurling a punk through the air. Someone asked me whether the destruction of your own person was a mandatory cost, or part of the effect. If they activated it without having a person to throw, would it still do its damage? Come on.

These days, I tell people quite openly that the rules of Radlands are shallow, and inconsistent. Some questions will have arbitrary rulings that are good for gameplay, or match the theme. Others simply have no answer.

Write game text for ordinary people to understand, not for precision.

Clear purpose
My gangster game contained a card called "Stash". This put two money tokens on the location that the player to your right is on.

Everyone understood what the card did, but no one understood why they'd want to play it. It just seemed wacky and useless.

To me, it was obvious. I play the card, and I put two money tokens under the player to my right. On their turn, they move off that space. I'm the next player around the table, so I'll be the first player who's able to move onto that now-free space, and collect the money.

Even competent gamers didn't understand this card.

The card now has the same text, but at the bottom of the card, there is a small line of text saying: "(Hint: Go there next turn, and collect it.)" Now, everyone understands the card.

## theme.md
Theme
If you're designing theme-first, you must choose a fascinating theme. When you tell people the theme, they should immediately be interested.

Players and publishers are not interested in "a pirate game" or "a train game". To a jaded publisher, a game about the sewage system is vastly more interesting than another game about zombies. I kid you not. Your theme should be interesting, but doesn't need to be totally zany. Zany is definitely good though, if you can manage it. If a publisher somehow gets around to evaluating a boringly-themed game, and the mechanics interest them, they'll just retheme the game to something else — of their choosing.

My game Radlands was originally a generic futuristic game, but the publisher changed that to an over-the-top Mad Max theme. It was a huge improvement.

Don't make your game literally ten times harder to publish, by choosing a boring theme. It's ludicrous to have complete freedom with the theme, because you're designing theme-first, yet not actually choose an interesting or novel theme.

Even if your theme has been done before, and you don't want to change it, you can still put a new twist on it. If you have to do zombies (which you shouldn't), make it "zombies in Japan" or "zombie cats" or something.

You can just choose an amazing theme with no relation to your mechanics.

I would've made the game about animals, or something with more variety, but Wingspan's bird theme has helped make it hugely successful.

Feeling of the theme
I'm not really wanting to just evoke the theme itself. The theme leads to a larger feeling of the theme.

I don't just want a pretty, pirate-themed game. I want to feel like a pirate — roaming the sea, attacking other ships at will.

I don't want a spy-themed game. I want to feel like a spy — planning secret moves, and having secret information.

In case this distinction isn't clear, think about some examples from real life for a moment, without thinking about board games.

Imagine you're a kid arriving at a theme park, and there are more rides and activities than you can imagine.

Imagine the feeling of exploring a haunted house.

Imagine you're at the edge of a vast, unexplored wilderness.

Think of a game you really like. What is the feeling you get when you play it, or that you got when you first played it?

Turning a real-life feeling into an actual game is extraordinarily hard, but you only need a small amount of that feeling to come through in your game, for it to make an amazing board game. This is done not by slapping a theme on your game rules, but by carefully choosing game rules that bring out your theme.

Theme size
The size of the theme should also match the size of the game. Do not try to attach a big story to a small game.

Azul is a game about arranging coloured tiles. The theme is that you're making a Spanish tiled floor. That's an appropriate theme.

Codenames is a word association game. It's themed as a game about secret agents. That theme is completely irrelevant to the game.

In a friend's prototype, you place object tiles around cat cards. When a cat is surrounded by objects, you add up the points on the tiles, to see who takes the cat. This game was mechanics-first, other than the very general "cat" theme.

We went through all kinds of big-picture themes for the game. It could be a cat adoption place. But why would you adopt multiple cats, by placing objects around them? I suggested a cat cafe. That was better. However, nothing else in the game said "cafe". We agreed in the end that the story was just that you were having fun with cats. You give them objects, and they like you, and come to you. That was the extent of the story. It was the correct choice, because it matches what the game actually is.

I've seen numerous basic number or colour-matching games, with some kind of epic legend as a theme. Don't just pick the most awesome theme you can think of. Find whatever matches your game best.

Leave your theme broad, so it doesn't restrict you. Don't choose the exact time period, location, and size of your theme at the start. As you develop the game, your choice of individual cards and resources will help narrow things down.

Single-Player Themes
Some themes are inherently single-player (or cooperative.) If you're exploring a land, or going on a journey, for instance, how is this a competitive game? You can do these themes, but you might need to bend the theme, to explain why the players are competing.

I made a game where the players were trying to survive as shipwrecked castaways. That's an amazingly relatable theme, in my opinion.

I didn't want the mechanic of the players helping each other, so I made the castaways criminals. I didn't want player elimination, so I just decided that you would lose points rather, rather than die, if you failed to sustain yourself. But what is victory, in this game? I decided that the player who survived this experience best (by having the most points at the end) was the winner. This was all a bit strange, but none of it impinged on the feeling of being a castaway, which was well-supported by the other game elements.

The theme needs to be simple and strong
You need to be able to explain your theme in a few words. Telling a long story you invented, is not a theme. It's just a random collection of things.

I'd like to play a game about running an ant colony, or creating a mosaic. I know what those things are, and I want to play them in a game. I'm not so interested in being the Archmage of Kronglor, or recovering the Five Galactic Shards of Kozmog.

People need to be captivated by the theme of your game, and that's only going to happen if they can actually understand it.

I've designed games on all kinds of different themes, and people's reaction was usually fairly muted. Then, I started making a game about kids roaming around a neighbourhood on their skateboards, and getting up to all the mischief that kids get up to. This theme resonated strongly with people, and they were immediately fascinated and engaged by it. If you're designing theme-first, this is what you should be aiming for.

Having said all this, I don't recommend starting theme-first. It's much easier to use a preexisting mechanical framework, that's known to work in other games.

## turnStructure.md
Turn Structure
A game turn should be simple, easy, and interesting. It should not be a list of steps and procedures.

After complexity, this is probably the #2 criticism I have of other designers' games I playtest.

This is a huge mistake I see in game expansions. Have you ever felt like a game was simpler and better without its expansion? That extra step each turn/round has a cost.

Phases and actions
A turn should not be comprised of "phases" unless absolutely necessary. Make a turn about a single, consequential action. Remove or minimise everything else.

Turn structure is a very high design priority. Redesign other parts of your game, in order to simplify it.

Work backwards from a simple turn structure.

Simpler turns are easier, but they're also quicker. In my experience, boring games are usually boring because of downtime, i.e. waiting for other players' lengthy and complex turns.

A poor game designer argues the case as to why these steps are necessary. A good designer abolishes them, and then finds other ways to make the game work.

Number of actions
Doing two things on your turn is acceptable. If you can move then attack, that's fine. If you get income, then spend it, that's fine too. For more complex games, three actions is more appropriate — two choices, and one maintenance step. For simple games, you cannot exceed two steps: one choice, plus one small maintenance step.

There's a simple test here, for you and your playtesters: are there parts of the turn that you keep forgetting, don't actually care about, or are a drag? If so, your turn structure is wrong.

In Pulsar 2849, on each turn, each player will place two dice. They'll use this to fly spaceships around, build things, and upgrade technology. This is interesting. However, at the start of each round, there's an extensive and convoluted phase where players choose their dice for the round, from a shared pool of rolled dice. Furthermore, players typically plan out their whole round during this phase, before picking dice.

Limit choice
If a player has to make a choice, they'll take time to think about that choice. They'll do this, even if the choice isn't important.

In my farming game, I had ten little abitilies. Instead of making a space that let you choose three of them, I just bundled them into groups of three or four.
Steps in a turn are bad, but steps with choices in them are far worse.

Try to confine the choices to one part of the turn, and make those choices important. Make the rest of the turn automatic and choiceless.

Don't go overboard in this. A simple and automatic drawing of one card per turn is likely worthwhile.

In my gangster game, drawing one card per turn gave too many cards, so I let players buy one, at the end of each turn. This step now contained a decision, which slowed the game right down. I eventually decided that, if there had to be an extra step, it would simply be to draw one card. This was too many cards, so I made a portion of the deck super-simple, non-functional cards. These "Package" cards can be collected, and delivered to certain locations in bulk, to exchange for resources. These cards have almost no complexity, so a player having numerous packages, and one or two regular cards, doesn't overwhelm them, like a hand of several regular cards would.

The Magic card "Sensei's Divining Top" lets you look at the top three cards of your deck, and rearrange them. Players would use it once or more per turn. Its benefit was small, but required extensive thought. The card was eventually banned.

Do not force the players to discard down to X cards each turn. That's another whole pile of complex but unimportant decisions.

Some tips
All turn options should generally be put into one menu. They should not be a series of different menus of choices. "You may do A or B or C" is much faster than "you may do A or B, then you may do C or not", and offers the player more freedom. For more complex parts of a game, players might pick more than one choice, but it would still be from one menu. Giving each thing a cost works in much the same way.

In Radlands, you can put people onto the table, and you can have them use their abilities. You can use your camps, or use special actions like drawing a card, or playing a special event. However, all these things are in a single step. There is no separate "combat phase". All these things cost an amount of water to activate, and you have three water to spend each turn. Once you've spent your water, you end your turn.

Be careful of giving players options they can do on a turn, but usually don't. These always require thinking, and they can also make it unclear when a player's turn has actually ended.

Another way to simplify your turn structure is to cut your turns up into small bits, and have each bit be a turn. It's better to do half as much on a turn, if it means you wait half as long for your turn.

For simpler games, "rest turns" are fine, wherein you might just draw a new hand of cards, replenish your energy, or the like. This allows you to remove "draw a card each turn" or "gain one energy each turn" from the turn structure, which is often essential for family-weight games.

In Ticket to Ride, a player's turn is either spending cards to build "tracks" on the board, OR taking two new cards. I agree with this structure, especially since the game is fairly light and simple.

Cut out tiny tasks and choices from players' turns.

In Ticket to Ride, there are five train cards, and on your turn, you can take two of them. However, once you take your first card, you draw a new card to replace it, and then you decide which second card to take. This means that you have to consider if you want the new card. This adds a second small decision and a task to the turn. I would've just had the player take two cards, THEN replace them.

Get rid of maintenance
I just want to play the game!

A player's turn should just be about doing the thing (or things) they want to do, plus minimal (ideally zero) maintenance and bookkeeping.

If there are tasks that must be done, to maintain the game state, try extremely hard to move them from the turn to the round.

Putting out ten tokens at the start of a round is fine. Having ten turns, in which the player must also put out one token, is not so good.

Even better, get away from having "rounds" entirely. Rounds tend to exist because a game needs to undergo housekeeping. Does your game really need that housekeeping?

In one of my prototypes, players moved to spaces around a town, that had various effects. Typically, they'd let the player draw some cards.

To stop a player using a spot repeatedly, and encourage them to move around the board, the player put a "depletion" counter on the space when they used it, so it couldn't be used again. I wanted to get rid of this step.

I removed the depletion counters, and replaced them with "stash" counters. These added goodies to certain spaces on the board, to encourage players to move across the board, to get them. I needed far less of them, as just a few stashes would keep the players moving around all game.

After moving, the player would also draw a "Change" card. These cards moved the non-player characters around the board, advanced the time, removed those depletion counters, and caused larger game events to happen. I wanted to get rid of those too.

I put the Change cards into other decks, so they would be drawn occasionally, as part of players' regular turns. After all this, the turn was simply to move, and draw the good cards. Only occasionally, you'd get a card that placed stashes, or did other work. You'd do it, and draw a new good card to replace it.

Player-controlled gameplay
Try to keep game-controlled effects out of the game. Yes, you can have "event cards" that happen periodically, or "neutral players" that perform actions, but does the game need them? If they're needed, make them very simple and quick. Far better to let a player control the "bad guy" momentarily, and use it to attack their opponents, than to have a whole process for deciding what the bad guy does.

In one of my prototypes, I decided that you could get a bad "reputation". But if you had a bad reputation, what did that mean? I could've had neutral characters who would periodically chase you, or detect you and react to you. I decided not to do that. Instead, it's the other players who can target you, and steal your points, if you have a bad reputation. It's far simpler, and requires no maintenance.

## weight.md
Game Weight
Weight is a game's complexity and difficulty of play, though there's no standard definition.

Weight tends to be classified as light, medium, or heavy. As an example, Bridge would be at the heavy end, while Dominoes would be at the light end.

Greater weight means a game is harder to learn and play, and will appeal to far less people.

Lighter games also tend to have less components. This appeals to more people, given financial and space constraints.

Given two otherwise-identical games, the lighter one is superior.

Less work
When developing larger games, each change or problem requires long periods of thought, and there are so many components to update, each revision. It's far less fun than designing a lighter game.

Heavier games are also much harder to design. When a big group of systems just isn't fun, it can be extraordinarily hard to analyse.

Don't design anything above medium-light, until you're onto your 20th design.

At the end of it all, there's no extra reward for designing a heavy game. Likely the opposite is true. Everyone will play a medium-light game. Only a minority of people will play a medium-heavy game.

I regard designing above medium weight to be almost unnecessary. If your game is heavier than medium, I'd be almost certain that it shouldn't be.

Medium is the new heavy.

Medium-light is the new medium.

## whoGoesFirst.md
Who Goes First?
It's a little bit feelbad for one player to have the unfair advantage of going first, but someone has to go first.

It's fine
Assuming you're interested in your depth:complexity ratio, you should seriously consider not mitigating the first-player advantage. The objective of mitigating first-player advantage is to improve the game. Adding unnecessary complexity or strange rules, is often not worthwhile.

How big is the advantage? In a game with many small turns, it's probably not worth worrying about. In a game with fewer turns, where the turns are significant, it's a bigger problem.

Advantage of going first
In a two-player game, the second player will get one less turn in half of all games. So, on average, they're getting half a turn less. You compensate for this, by making the first turn a half-value turn, or by giving the second player an extra half a turn worth of goodies. In a game with more players, the last player should get compensation almost equal to a turn.

Mitigating first-player advantage
The ideal place to apply mitigation is inside the game components themselves, because it's invisible, and adds no complexity.

In Scrabble, there's no special rule for going first, it's just that there aren't many premium squares you can reach on the first turn.

For most games, however, the solution is simple. You find the most basic game resource, and dole it out in differing amounts, based on the player order.

In Lords of Waterdeep, the player going first begins the game with 4 coins, the second player 5 coins, the third player 6, etc.

In Star Realms, players draw a new hand of five cards each turn. To mitigate the first-player advantage, the player who goes first gets a hand of only three cards on their first turn. It's like a mini-turn. Perfect.

My gangster game had two resources: Health and Money. Everyone started with ten health, and some small amount of money. I gave the players, in turn order, 1/2/3/4/5 money tokens, to begin the game. However, this was too much, and 4 or 5 money tokens allowed the later players access to very powerful effects. A turn is only worth about three money tokens. In the end, I settled on a 0/1/1/2/2 system. Slightly more complicated, but still very a fairly simple solution.

However, players 3 and 5 are disadvantaged by this system, as they get the same amount of money as the player who goes before them. So, how about if players three and five got some Health instead of some or all of their money? I could make a combination that's very fair.

This goes too far. Having 11 or 12 Health at the start of the game might be fair, but it makes the strategy of the game different, based on your seating position. It's also rather odd, and is not easily remembered. A player would have to refer to a chart each game. It's not worthwhile.

You should not create something that has an ongoing effect, or that warps the game in some way. I'm not a fan of the "keep going until everyone's had equal turns" rule. That means the effect of going first is something that will persist to the end of the game, and matter again. Fair, yes. Wonky, yes also.

Variable turn order
In round-based games, it's fine for the starting player to change from round to round. This is a very simple and interesting choice you can add to a player's options for their turn. If it doesn't fit in, you can just have a starting player marker move clockwise around the table each round.

Don't use completely variable turn order, where play doesn't go around the table in a circle. This is usually accompanied by this turn order changing every round. This is an annoying and time-consuming mechanic, and people will constantly be getting it wrong, and forgetting that it's their turn. As always, if the game is about the varying turn order, it's perfectly acceptable (Kingdomino, Power Grid.)

The minimal solution
This problem is not an opportunity to stuff in extra flair and complexity. First player advantage is a problem that should be solved with the most unobtrusive solution that works — or not at all.

## winningAndLosing.md
Winning & Losing
The victory condition of a game isn't as important as it might seem. People just want to enjoy the game.

Points
Some games have a logical end, that ties strongly into the theme.

My gangster game ends when you've eliminated all the other players.

For many games, particularly less-adversarial games, there is no organic end. The game has to end at some point, and the question of who wins should simply be "who did the best stuff?"

In this case, add a points system to the game, that rewards the player for generally doing good stuff. The winner is the player who has the most points at the end.

As with everything, keep it simple. Don't chase mathematical accuracy, at the cost of complexity.

In Century: Spice Road, all spice cubes are worth one point, except for the worst type, which are worth zero. This is a good compromise.

Player elimination
In general, players should not be eliminated from a game. It's not fun having to wait for the game to finish. Especially, don't have players eliminated early in the game.

Elimination can, however, raise the stakes, and create amazing tension. Elimination is appropriate for a small minority of games. Cliffhanger moments can be some of the best moments in gaming. Imagine TV show Survivor, without elimination.

The key to cliffhangers is that the player probably survives each cliffhanger. No more chance, no less.

My gangster game goes for about 20 minutes, but players are injured at fairly similar speeds. If anyone is eliminated, it's likely very late in the game, and there's a good chance many players are eliminated at once, possibly ending the game. The eliminations rely on the luck of the dice, which provides endless cliffhanger moments. When players are eliminated, they typically stay engaged with the game, wanting to see who wins, as the survivors battle it out, on the verge of death.

Tiebreakers
Sometimes, the game is a tie. What happens, then?

I'm okay with a game being a draw. Players find it amusing, and neither player is the loser.

I don't like tying, and then reaching for the rulebook, to see "who really won". Equal performance equals a tie, in my books.

Gameplay aside, I don't think tiebreakers are worth the extra complexity, but many designers insist on having them.

The worst tiebreakers are the random ones.

In Splendor, the player with the most points wins. If players have equal points, the player with the least cards wins. This is simply flipping a coin. There is almost no time at which you should try to get less cards. It only matters in the case of a tie. No one has been focussing on it, and it's essentially random.

Other poor tiebreakers include turn-based tiebreakers. Whoever has had the most turns loses the game. This attempts to fuse two problems together — balancing the starting player advantage, and creating a tiebreaker. However, this leaves a permanent warping on the game, such that the game is slightly different for both players, all the way through. Also, I have to go and check who was first.

Your tiebreaker, if you want one, should be the person who wins by more, or would be in the lead, if the game kept going slightly longer. To find this player, follow the victory chain backwards. If the player with the most houses wins, and houses are bought with gold, then the player with the most gold should win the tie.

Don't create a second tiebreaker, if the first one is still tied. The complexity is not justified. The game can just be a tie 0.1% of the time.

## work.md
Work
"Work" is where a player must do non-entertaining physical or mental tasks, in order for the game to function.


Work is bad
Keep it to a minimum.

Work that's a regular part of the game turn, is a huge negative. You should consider changing your game significantly, to remove such work. It is not a minor factor.

It's also very easy to forget to do the work, and have to fix up the game.

This includes things like restocking spaces with resources, restocking and advancing a card row, and shuffling/dealing cards.

Setup
Your game should have minimal setup and teardown. Avoid having boards pre-populated with stuff. Have players add the stuff during the game.

I've seen numerous positive mentions of Radlands having almost no setup. You just shuffle and begin. It's really nice.

Some games are adjusted for different player counts, by forcing the players to go through each deck, and remove certain cards. This is common, and should be avoided wherever possible.

When you play Bärenpark with less than four players, it tells you to remove some combination of tiles from each of the piles of tiles numbered 1-7. Do I really have to do that? Would the game be terrible if there were just too many of those tiles? This is in addition to having to arrange all the game's components on a board to begin with.

Ideally, just change the game, so the work isn't necessary.

Isn't it nice to get out a game you can just play? 

Calculation
Yes, it's nice to find an exact mathematical equation that matches your design objectives, but players don't want to do mathematics.

Keep numbers as small as possible. Not everyone is good at mathematics. I can total five dice, or add 16 and 27 instantly. Many people can't, and I would still rather not have to do it.

Halve all the numbers in your game. Does it still work properly? Good. Keep going. You might like the exact ratio of the buildings worth two and seven points, but just make them one and three points, please.

Something in your game should be worth one point. If that's not the case, your point values are too high.

Observation
A player must be observant, to make sure a condition is or isn't being met, or must constantly evaluate known information, such as how much money each opponent has.

The game Dead of Winter contains "crossroad" cards. The player who draws it keeps it secret, and when the secret condition on the card is met, the player reveals the card, and something happens. People like these, but they generate an ongoing and distracting observation task for the players, and a high potential for mistakes.

Counting
Try not to make exact high numbers matter.

In Race for the Galaxy, players must discard down to ten cards in hand at the end of each of their turns. That means every large hand of cards needs to be constantly counted.

Magic's Odyssey expansion introduced the "threshold" mechanic. While seven or more cards are in your discard pile, some bonus effect occurs. This requires that players constantly tally the number of cards in their discard piles.

A better way to do this is to make the number only be counted at certain points, or when certain things happen.

In Catan, whenever any player rolls a 7, all players with more than seven cards discard half their cards. This is much less work than forcing players to discard down to seven cards at the end of every turn.

Scoring
Does your game have to have "point salad", where everything is worth points? Can you make lots of things just be worth the same number of points? Can you just make things worth nothing?

I've dealt with this problem in my farming game. There is no scoring of your farm. You just reveal your objective cards, and add them up.

Memory issues
Memory issues are where a player must remember something. This might be in order to make the game function properly, but is usually just advantageous information that the player should keep a mental note of.

"Look at a player's hand. They discard a card of your choice." That's a decent ability, but the player really should take note of all their opponent's other cards, and keep them in mind. That's not fun, but you're a bad player if you don't.

In Splendor, players can reserve cards from the table, to buy later. However, when they do, they turn the card face down. Players should take note of this likely-important card, but that's mentally taxing, so they don't. Later, the player plays the card, and wins.

I don't like to have to keep something in mind. I just want to think about my strategy. If there's something that people have to be forced to remember, get rid of it. Alternatively, make it something good, that they'll want to remember. Or, make it something big, that they'd notice if they forgot. Or, use a physical component or cue to remind you.

Some games are about memory. That's fine, but most people don't really like memory games.

Once information has been made public, try to keep it public, or throw it away.

Referring
Don't make the players look up data. Everything in the game should be memorisable. This includes game setup.

Cards with text should be self-explanatory. If a normal person will read the card, and need to check the FAQ, the card needs to be rewritten.

Players Must Enjoy Their First Game
The first time someone plays your game, their enjoyment is crucial.

Each copy of your game will be played many times by its owner, but by many other players, once. This is because they're playing it at a games club, or after a dinner. That impression really counts.

People will play your game more than once, but only if they enjoy it the first time. By the end of their first game, they must fully understand the game. Preferably, they understand it very early on, and spend their time strategising, not simply trying to understand the rules.

Personally, I have no time for games that aren't good on the first play. Maybe they're great after ten plays. I'm not going to invest the time to find out. 

Many fans of Radlands have told me that they've had numerous occasions whereupon they've played the game with someone once, and that person bought the game immediately. I was told that one player even stopped playing mid-game, and started using his phone. When his opponent asked him what he was doing, he said he was buying the game online.

Beginner setup
As much as possible, you need to build a ramp for new players, so they can ease into your game. 

Include a "beginner setup", which specifies the setup of the game, for the players' first game. This setup should use not just the simplest game elements, but also the ones that have the most straightforward effects and benefits.

This lets you keep players away from complex or unusual game elements designed for experienced players.

There is no reason not to do this.

In Catan, the players create a random board out of hexagonal map pieces. Then, they take turns placing two settlements on the board. The beginner setup instead has a picture of the setup, and says "set the board up like this, and put the players' settlements here."

In Radlands, there are dozens of different location cards. Each player is dealt six, and chooses three to keep.

For players who haven't played the game before, the rules instruct them to instead use three specific location cards each. This eliminates the pre-game location choice, which is meaningless to them, and it gives each player three simple locations, to ease them into the game. I also biased this set of locations towards aggression and normality, so that the players' first game would more likely be a quick, action-packed brawl.

You can even give players hands of specific cards.

Family version
If your game is very complicated, you should go even further, and create a "family version", where you remove some systems from the game entirely, for the players' first game.

Reminder cards
For all but the simplest games, I always use reminder cards.

A reminder card is a card of very brief rules. It's typically used to display data, not large blocks of rules text.

I use reminder cards to reduce the complexity of my rules, not just to provide information in a handy format for the players.

Allow me to explain.

In my gangster game, there are four unique custom dice. During development, I replaced all the boring "do 2 damage" and "gain 3 health" type of die faces. The game now has fifteen different die faces. I made sure each die face was extra-simple, but fifteen is still a very large number. I put all of these on a handy reminder sheet. The rules for the game are barely a single page, and they just say "start playing now. Refer to the reminder sheet to see what the die rolls mean." Players can start playing straight away, and during their first game, they really do learn all the die faces long before the first game ends.

Component Limitations
Your game should use as few pieces as possible, and they should be the standard game pieces.

Keep it small
If you don't understand this, a publisher will teach it to you the hard way, when they insist you cut down your game, or, far more likely, just reject it outright.

Minimising components isn't as important as fun, simplicity, or other matters, but it's certainly next on the list. You should be considering it as you design your game.

You're also giving your players, who don't have infinite money, more value for their money.

It's a big cost for a publisher to print vast quantities of components. Do you really need all those dice in the game? Does each player need to have a separate deck? Can that deck be half the size, and still work the same? Does the board need to be huge?

Always try to make your game with standard components. Almost all games can be done this way, and still look great.

Standard pieces are regular dice (4-20 sided dice are fairly standard too), simple coloured wooden bits (various cubes, discs, men), punchboard (thick cardboard for boards, chits, and other flat pieces), and cards.

Things like custom dice (dice with faces that aren't numbers), and unusual resource tokens (fancy resource shapes, animal shapes) are still mostly acceptable.

Miniatures and other custom-moulded plastic pieces are very expensive.

Artwork
It's not the amount of art that goes into your game, it's the amount of unique art that goes into the game. Most cards in your decks should exist as multiple copies of the same card. There should be a few rarer cards that only exist as singles, but most cards should be doubles or triples.

Use both sides
A deck of cards you draw from, during the game, can't be double-sided. Most other things can.

Boards, chits, and cards not in decks, can all have a second side. This is a great way to fit everything onto less components, or add variation.

If you have two things that don't work well together, or do something very similar, you can just put them on opposite sides of the same component, so they can never both be in the game at the same time.

Make sure that all components are being used regularly. Do not include components that are only occasionally used.

Every component in the game must be entirely necessary.

The Core
The central mechanic or mechanics you choose become the core of your game. In a way, the core is your game.

Just the core, please
Once you've worked out your core, remove everything else from your game, other than what's needed to support and enhance the core. I want to be playing your amazing core, not a whole lot of other stuff.

Dominion was the first "deck-builder" game (each player starts with a weak deck, and uses its cards to buy more and better cards to shuffle into it.) The designer originally had this as the core of a much larger game, but, in the end, he removed all that extra stuff, and the game was a hit.

Many designers think they need to make an epic game around their core, but the correct choice is often a relatively simple, half-an-hour game. Each irrelevant or extraneous thing you add, makes your game worse.

If your game is about one thing, and that thing is great, then your game is great. If it's about ten different activities, then they all need to be great, for the game to be great.

There's no point adding anything else to your game, or proceeding, until you have a good core. Do not go off and work on other parts of the game. No amount of good ideas, work, art, and other things matter if the core doesn't work.

Clarity
There's a second advantage of just focussing on the core of your game.

Imagine the following game (I just made it up):

There's a ten by ten grid. On each of your turns, you add a stone of your colour to the board. Players cannot place stones adjacent (including diagonal) to their opponent's stones. The player with the most stones on the board at the end wins.

It's nice that this game has such simple rules, and can be understood so easily. You can start strategising immediately.

The game above is an interesting puzzle, precisely because it's a very simple and clear problem. It's not a sprawling array of mechanics, but poses a very stark and simple question to you. If this example interests you, it's not going to be made more interesting if I add extra things on top of it.

I call this clarity. The more your game is about its central challenge, the more clarity it has.

This game is not interesting enough for me to want to play it twice, but it is interesting momentarily.

Give the players a distilled experience of one simple concept.

Deck Design
A deck is a single thing, that serves a purpose. It's not just a collection of cool cards.

Simple
What are the simplest possible cards that could exist in your game? They should exist, because their complexity is super-low, and their gameplay value might be reasonable. Many of your cards should be nothing more than an icon. Most should be one sentence, and maybe an icon. Next, do cards that have two icons on them, or an icon and a sentence of text. Then, two sentences.

Look at every rule of your game, and make a card that breaks it in some way.

Not all of these cards will work, but you should try them.

Straightforward
In addition, most of the deck should be composed of cards that do very straightforward things. They shouldn't be situational or unusual or flashy. They should be things you'd usually want, even if those things are boring on their own. The hand as a whole is what's interesting, not the individual cards.

When players draw a hand of cards, it should be very easy to understand, useful, and maybe have one wacky or exciting card.

A deck is a deck, not a collection of cards. Most of its contents will be boring and functional.

how many cards?
To further simplify the deck, and make it more functional, I skew card decks heavily towards the aforementioned simple & straightforward cards. I put three to five of those cards in the deck, and only one or two of each of the exciting and strange ones.

I try to keep decks as small as possible, especially if the deck isn't the core of the game. You can easily make a deck much better, by halving its size, and keeping only the best half.

Predictability
There's also another axis to consider here: predictability. I like to add strategy to games with cards, by giving the players some idea of what cards the opponent will play. If there are some common cards in the deck, a player can anticipate them, and strategise accordingly.

If the deck is full of unique cards, players won't be able to strategise at all. The opponent's cards will just hit them out of the blue, and it will be feelbad. 

Use a deck
A general piece of advice here: Cards do a lot of good things for a game. They provide choices. They're a well ofrdepth and replayability. They help tie turns together. If the cards are in players' hands, they're hidden information, and which pushes your game away from calculability, and towards intuition.

Most games should have a deck of cards.

Deck construction
Avoid "deck construction" (this is where players can modify or build their own deck before the game.) Many players will not want to play a complex metagame on top of your game. Deck construction also likely requires multiple products, to enable the full spectrum of deck-construction possibilities. It probably also necessitates a community, where you can trade for cards you want for your deck. The vast majority of players don't want to interact this strongly with a game, or do non-game activities. If they do, they can just play a game like Magic, which is designed specifically around that concept. Publishers are also likely to shy away from competing with the giants that already dominate this field.

Just make a normal game.

The Depth: Complexity Ratio
Design your game not just for maximum depth, but also for minimum complexity.

This is probably the most important article on this site.

Depth is how strategic and interesting something is.

Your simple game isn't going to be as deep as Through the Ages or Agricola, but most people aren't interested in complex, brain-burner games that take several hours. They want something they can easily understand and be competitive in, the first time they play it.

Your game is not competing with heavier or lighter games. It is competing only with games of the same complexity.

The Depth:Complexity ratio is central to my design process, not an afterthought or minor matter. Many designers seem to ignore it entirely.

Minimise complexity
Think of complexity as a kind of money you can spend. When you spend it, you want to add as much good stuff to your game as possible. Also, you want to "sell" (remove) parts of your game that are complex, but don't add much to the game. That complexity can then be re-spent elsewhere, to add something that adds cool gameplay.

I've played and playtested many games that had all kinds of rules, bits, and procedures, but amounted to nothing more than a simple puzzle. If I want to play a simple puzzle game, I'll play Splendor or Azul, not the same game wrapped up in cumbersome and complex baggage.

It might sound counterintuitive to remove a part of your game that adds positive gameplay, but if it generates enough of a reduction in complexity, it's a good thing, even if you don't re-spend that complexity elsewhere. You need to let your game slide around on the complexity scale. It's okay if it ends up more or less complex than you had intended, if its ratio will be optimised.

My epic pirate adventure ended up as a small, simple pick-up-and-deliver game, with a few dice. It was better for it.

My farming game is big and involved. However, I managed to remove enough complexity from it, so that it's appealing to most mid-weight gamers.

The Depth:Complexity ratio isn't linear. Increased complexity enables exponentially greater gameplay. This means that more complex games and elements must be vastly better than the simpler ones.

You might think your game is fairly simple, for what it is, and that only the necessary stuff is in there. That's almost certainly not the case. Your game is far more complicated than you think it is.

Coming up with complex things is easy. Coming up with simple things is hard.

There are all kinds of other benefits of simplicity, that I'll talk about later in the site.

Elegance
A finished game should be elegant — it should appear childishly simple, and not far from self-explanatory. It should not be covered in text, keywords, icons, and numbers, and look complicated. It should look so simple that people assume it's a very light game.

Strategic depth should come from the interaction of many simple parts, not from the internal complexity of complex parts.

Radlands is so elegant that people initially looked at it and said "I don't see what's good here", but the game ended up being an enormous success, with people lauding its simplicity.

Making Sure the Game Ends
A game's length should not vary too much above its typical length. If it does, it can become boring, or cause issues for the players.

In the classic game Diplomacy, players' pieces battle for control of Europe. The pieces are not destroyed, and can simply push each other back and forth forever.

Ratchets
A game's features should push it towards a conclusion. I call such systems "ratchets". A "hard ratchet" moves the game continuously and irreversibly in one direction. The game might end in a set number of rounds. This is a hard ratchet.

 A "soft ratchet" generally moves the game in one direction, but the game can move backwards, or simply stay where it is. The end of the game is inevitable, but getting there could be slow or quick.

Most games have inherent ratchets in them. If your game doesn't, put one in.

Dwindling components
Scrabble has 100 tiles, which are depleted at a fairly predictable rate, after which, the game ends. This is a fairly hard ratchet.

Chess has two softer ratchets — the fact that pawns can't go backwards, and, more importantly, the fact that captured pieces do not return. However, pawns often become stuck, and the game still works without them. Unlike Scrabble, Chess turns can be played without the loss of components. Pieces can just keep moving around. All this makes Chess games vary in length much more than games of Scrabble do.

The Ramp
This is a ratchet that gets harder and harder as the game progresses.

Some number in the game is inexorably increased. This causes effects to increase in magnitude, and become more likely to end the game.

Poker continually ramps up the blinds (automatic starting bids), until players are playing with very large proportions of their money each hand. Each player is only a few hands away from elimination, and players are thus rapidly eliminated.

A ramp can also be good for other reasons. It makes the game bigger and more exciting, or just different, as it goes on.

The backup ratchet
Magic has a Ramp built into it — the "land" system. Players play more and more land cards, which facilitate larger and larger spells. This doesn't necessarily mean the game will end though. However, there's another ratchet: a game of Magic also ends when one player's deck runs out. That's rare, but it stops a very small number of super-slow games becoming never-ending games.

If you can't guarantee your ratchet, it can be wise to put a much slower but more certain ratchet behind it, by declaring that a dwindling resource eventually triggers game-end, if nothing else does.

Finishers
Similarly to Magic, in my gangster game, players have health, and they lose the game when their health falls to zero.

The game is slanted in the direction of decreasing health, but not heavily. Players can gain significant amounts of health, as well as lose it. In some setups, and with a bit of luck, players can stay alive for a very long time, despite the slant.

I added a number of "finisher" locations into the game. These are places a player can go, that have a good chance of eliminating players. These places cost large amounts of money to go to, so they can't be accessed too early, or without effort, but they're like mini-ramps, where the volatility of the game briefly skyrockets, and even entrenched players can be eliminated.
The slant
Magic also has another ratchet, a life total. When a player's life total is reduced to zero, they lose the game. There's nothing stopping them from gaining life, however. Despite the face that a player can gain life, they usually don't gain much.

The game is statistically slanted in the direction of decreasing life totals, and usually ends in reasonable time.

Reliability of ratchets
Your ratchets must work under all circumstances. They can't rely on certain cards being drawn (unless those cards are extremely common.)

Earlier in the design of my gangster game, I added Machine Gun item cards as ramps. These would make you permanently do more damage to the other players. However, these cards could be on the bottom of the deck, and players weren't compelled to use the card when they drew it.

Similarly, my finisher locations might not be present on the table in a particular game. I changed the distribution of the cards such that one finisher location was always present, and made sure that all of them were at least reasonably lethal.

If your game only has a soft ratchet, look at each thing in the game, and ask "Does this progress the game"?

The entire game is a decline, or an ascent. Look at it as a whole, rather than from one player's POV.

Just use a hard ratchet
I've struggled a lot with soft ratchets, and my strong feeling, these days, is just to use a hard ratchet. If your game doesn't have one, add a new system that's a hard ratchet.

One of the biggest ongoing problems with Radlands, that can't really ever be completely fixed, has been games that take way longer than the average game length. The game has no real ratchets, so I've just had to bake slants in all over the place. I think I've largely mitigated the problem, but it's pushed the game very much towards aggressive play.

Alternate win conditions
These days, I'm a big fan of having multiple ways to win. If your game has a win condition other than points (or whoever has the most of something), you should add points as well. Alternate win conditions function a bit like a catch-up mechanism, in that a losing player may still be able to win on one win condition, making the game still fun. They're also a hard ratchet.

In my gangster game, I ended up adding two ratchets. One is "gang members", which increases the damage you do to other players, when you attack. As this number approaches 10, the opponents' chance of survival gets very low. That's a strong ratchet, but it's not guaranteed to work.

I also added points, which I called "reputation". You win the game if you get 10. It's not the usual way to win, but it kicks in, in longer games. Trying to make the game end without this ratchet had been an intractable problem.

feelbad.md
================================================================================

daniel.games
Feelbad Situations
Feelbad situations are where the player feels bad about something that happens during the game. It doesn't matter why players feel bad, or if their misfortune is actually fair. Avoid creating these situations.

Don't penalise
In general, winning players should gain points or resources, rather than losing players lose them. It can work out exactly the same, but the feeling is different.

No one gains any points. Ben, you lose 5 points!
Aww...

Don't interfere with my stuff
Ben: I spend the ten gold I've collected, to buy this cool horse! Yeah! Now I'll be able to gallop around. I'll go and attack the dragon now.

Tom: The dragon attacks you. It rolls a 6. Your horse and all your equipment are destroyed.

I was enjoying building up my character. Now, I'm back at the start of the game. Penalise the player in some way that doesn't send the game back in time.

Have a second prize
Another feelbad situation is when a player gets no recognition for what they achieved, because it's an all-or-nothing system.

If you meet the objective, you get rewarded. If you almost meet it, you get nothing.

In 7 Wonders, you can put a lot of effort into your military, but if your neighbour is one point stronger than you, you get nothing. Also, you wasted all those resources on military, and the people who didn't even try to do military will be well ahead of you.

Avoid making "all or nothing" mechanics. Game scores should proportionally reflect who did well over the course of the game.

"Strictly worse" outcomes
Randomness can often be very feelbad.

Getting a bad roll or card draw is feelbad, but, obviously, not all rolls or draws can be the same.

When a player gets something "bad", don't make it clearly worse than another option, in every way. Just make it different in some way, to hide the fact that it's worse. If you have a Spear with scores 3 and 3, it's fine to have an Axe with 1 and 4, even though it might be worse. It at least has some upside over the Spear. What's not okay is to have a Sword with 2 and 2. This is strictly worse than the Spear, and the player who gets it will feel ripped off. Obviously, if these things have costs or other factors, it's fine. Also, if the better version is rare, and the weaker one is common, that's fine, too. People will expect the weak Sword, and be pleasantly surprised to draw the stronger Spear.

Make it different in some way, to try to muddy the waters a bit.

In my gangster game, I had a die that causes other players to lose an amount of health. One face of this die was just the "1" — one damage. This roll felt terrible. I decided to turn the "1" roll into "Shakedown". This meant that each opponent could give you a dollar, and if they didn't, then they'd lose one health. This was still a poor roll, but people were usually pleased to gain a dollar or two, and they didn't feel like they just rolled the worst option.

Restrictions
Do not force the player to do something, where they once had a choice. "You cannot move" might be a fair effect in some game, but it's probably not good design. Do not interfere with regular card draw.

It doesn't matter if it's fair or not, avoid taking players' choices away.

Do not make loss of choice and good strategy one and the same. If an effect says "do this if you have no cards in hand", the player will just waste their cards, and do it, and then have no choices afterwards.

If you have unique player powers, or other effects that change the game, they should be positive. Prohibiting or penalising things is almost always disliked by players. Even making them neutral effects that simply change how things work, is often annoying for players.

In my gangster game, each player has a criminal "profile" dealt to them at the start of the game. These change the rules somewhat, for that player, for that game. Junkie had to spend his money to buy health, every turn, and Loner gained information instead of gang members. These characters were thematic and fair, but they were annoying to play. Almost all profiles are now positive, giving an extra ability.

In the Radlands expansion, I was trying all kinds of outrageous camp card designs. They variously stopped you: playing people cards, "junking" (discarding unwanted cards for a small benefit), restoring (healing), or drawing your card for the turn. These all gave some powerful bonus, but they were all miserable to play.

Game Length
How long should a game be? As short as possible.

There is nothing inherently better about a game being longer. As with game weight, length can enable deeper play, but doesn't add anything on its own. A shorter game can just be played twice. As before, a shorter game appeals to more people. Your game is not competing with five-hour epic saga games that few people have time for.

For a game that ramps up, the game should be just long enough to allow the player to reach some of the biggest stuff in the game, if they choose to aim for it. It should be no longer. If a player can follow all paths to their end, the game is too long.

A good game ends one turn too soon.

If a game doesn't ramp up, or the ramping-up doesn't change the gameplay much, then the game can be even shorter. You just need a handful of game rounds, so a player gets the feel of the game, and can go through the basic game loop a few times, with their knowledge increasing each time.

Shortening a game
Properly minimising the turn structure will obviously help speed up a game, but a game might just be inherently long.

If your game has rounds, have as few as possible.

If your game has a goal, reduce its size.

If your game is too long, just lop off part (or most) of the game, and just save the best part.

One of my earliest prototypes had three stages, that ramped up nicely. It took an hour or so to play. All the stages were interesting, but the last one was a bit cumbersome. I just removed it. The end result is a 30-minute, medium-light game. It's better, and far shorter. 

My approach
A hundred years ago, many games took a few hours, with a short game being one hour, and a long game taking all afternoon.

These days, a few hours is considered to be on the long side for a game. An hour or so is normal, and half an hour is a short game.

This is still unnecessarily long.

A game's length should match its complexity and level of involvement. I design mostly at medium-light, which is the weight I recommend for most games. At that weight, aim for a game duration of 30 minutes.

Radlands is more mid-weight than medium-light. Its length, on average, is about 30 minutes. 

I can get everything done, in almost every game I design, in half an hour. I've never designed a game that goes for more than an hour.

Keep it short.

Gatekeepers and Control
Remember the example earlier in this site, with the room of 100 designers, from which maybe one game would be published?

Twenty of those guys are going to Kickstarter, because they all know their game is the one that should have been published.

Control
One of the reasons people go to Kickstarter is that it allows them to have complete control over their game, from rules to artwork. People like this. Many such designers are also resistant to feedback from me, and from other designers.

Control also allows a designer to design what they want, free of constraints that a publisher would likely impose. Publishers won't want games with certain business models, excessive components, or themes that are overused, fringe, or distasteful.

Some designers view their game as a personal art project, or creative challenge, and it therefore can't be adulterated by someone else. Of course, the designer will then try to publish the game — usually via Kickstarter. These designers live in a perfect world, where they can naively design what's most enjoyable for them, and have it also happen to be exactly what players want!

Dodging the gatekeepers
Maintaining control is a fatal mistake. The designer believes they're defending their game against ill-conceived changes by a publisher. More likely, it's paranoia, and signals an unwillingness to accept input. The publisher likely knows what they're doing, and is proposing sensible changes.

Like a football player running through the enemy team's lines, carrying the ball, this designer dodges playtesters and publishers — everyone who could give them the vital information they need about their game — that it's bad, or flawed.

A publisher is a brutal gatekeeper, who will force you to make better games, by rejecting your games, until you make a game that really is good enough. You think your current design is such a game, but it isn't.

Kickstarter
Kickstarter is a way for all kinds of kids to bypass the "you must be this tall to go on this ride" sign. They will fall off the ride and die, the same way that crap games will inevitably disappoint their purchasers.

I've always been sceptical of buying games from Kickstarter. After playing so many unpublishable prototypes, and watching them go to Kickstarter, I'm now loath to even play an unproven game from Kickstarter.

I've seen a few good games come from Kickstarter, but I've seen vastly more mediocre and unpolished drek.

Freedom
I could ask for more power, but I don't need to.

For the Radlands expansion, they just gave me complete control, without me even asking. That was a very good decision by them.

Even with this freedom, I don't just lock myself in a room, like Isaac Newton. I have a team of playtesters now, and their input is central to my work.

I didn't have control with Radlands. I had to work on an equal footing with an in-house developer. That was also a very good decision, because I wasn't good enough back then, and Roxley forced me to improve Radlands.

By the time you're in a position to ask for control, you won't need to. In the meantime, be happy to work with others.

General Benefit
Choices are only choices if they lead to known outcomes.

Options must be evaluable
Some choices seem strategic, but actually lack information that the player would base their decision on.

My gangster game once had three dice you could roll. One die got you money, another attacked the other players, and another gave a variety of useful effects and bonuses.

So, what's wrong here?

With the first two dice, you could plan out a strategy involving them. With the last die, you didn't know what you're going to get, so you couldn't plan anything.

To fix this problem, I increased the strength of the last die. However, the strategy remained the same. If you were winning, you'd roll this die, because it was good. And then, you'd probably be winning by even more. If you were losing, you had to formulate a specific plan, and roll one of the other dice.

Despite the last die being complex, the strategy ended up being too simple.

These days, there are four dice, and each does a very different and specific thing.

General strengthening
Avoid benefits that make a player just generally stronger.

Examples would be allowing the player to draw extra cards, or just granting them more income, in a game where the only resource is money. If the benefit is too broad, one player just feels generally stronger than another, and continuing the game seems pointless. And, for the stronger player, there's no new strategy created. 

The Radlands card Muse gives you an extra water (the game's basic resource) each turn, so you have 4, not 3. This just leads to the player with Muse playing more stuff. It doesn't matter what it is. The extra volume of stuff will wear the opponent down. They just have a simple, numerical advantage. (Radlands people can be easily killed, especially by a skilled player who knows to kill Muse, so it's not a big problem. I still wouldn't design a card like that these days.)

In Agricola, you start with two family members. This means you can take two turns per round. You can get a third person. That just makes you generally stronger, as you can then get more of everything.

"More turns/actions" is the most general benefit there is, and I recommend avoiding it.

Instead of general strengthening, make a player significantly stronger in one specific way. This means they can still be competed with in other ways. Players who gain power in different areas will all feel like they have a chance, because they're ahead in some way.

Future benefit
Near-future benefit is good for a game. It ties the turns together.

In both Magic and Radlands, you can't use your characters the turn they enter play. You have to wait until your next turn. You don't exactly know what you'll want next turn, so you have to intuit it.

If a benefit is too far in the future, it can become too general, and be stripped of its strategy.

In the Radlands expansion, there was a camp that allowed you to damage something, on your next turn. However, multiple cards would have likely entered and left play by then, so your damage would likely go somewhere you couldn't anticipate. Doing damage was still good, but it could only be evaluated as "a damage" versus its cost, as you didn't know what it was going to hit. It just became a general benefit.

In 7 Wonders, the first round is all about collecting resource and trade cards. However, these are really only important in round three, and somewhat in round 2. Round one is still an interesting puzzle, but it's very self-contained, because you don't know what's coming in later rounds. Rather than build up a big plan, you just collect a variety of resources.

Exploration
The "exploration" mechanic lets you go to an unexplored area of the map, and see what's there. It sounds fun, but why would you actually do it? Even if there are bonuses in there, you don't know what they are. You just have to average them all out, and step into the unknown.

Incidental benefit
An incidental benefit is one that you gain, without choosing to do so. You just gain it when you do something else, or it's an obvious benefit that you might as well gain.

Incidental benefits aren't the result of a strategic choice.

In my gangster game, there's a police cordon that can surround some locations. Being inside the cordon also protects you against the Drive By action, which is on one face of the red die. Players would sometimes go inside the cordon, but protection against Drive By was never the reason why. Drive By was only one face of the red die, so wasn't likely to be rolled. Players would sometimes be protected from Drive By, by the cordon, but it was just an incidental benefit. Drive By was supposed to be a cool effect which players could avoid, by hiding inside the cordon. It turned out to just be a more complicated and random version of regular damage.

I added Drive By to a second face of the red die. Now, it's twice as common, so you can expect a tangible benefit from hiding inside the cordon, which makes moving into the cordon factor into your strategy.

A choice is also not a choice if it doesn't make you change your strategy.

I added "Dens" to my gangster game. You put your den on a location, and every time you go there, you get an extra benefit. The problem is that you go to locations based on what you wanted to achieve. You got the extra bonus from the Den, but it didn't mean anything, or influence your decision.

A very common source of incidental benefit is where an action gives more than one benefit. These extra benefits will usually not factor into the player's strategy. That's fine if you're just trying to balance, but if that extra effect is supposed to be interesting and strategic, then it will fail to be so.

Distinct actions
Some actions don't have consequence because they're they're just a basket of goodies, that don't point to any strategy. They're not distinct from other baskets of goodies, so it doesn't really matter which one they take. They're all general benefit.

In one of my prototypes, players moved to various locations in a town, collecting different types of cards and bonuses. Let's just call them various letters. One would give you ABCD, one would give AABB, one CCDD. In this way, I could make a whole lot of different and interesting combinations, and I could make the benefits match the theme of the location.

I explained the rules to players, and they understood them easily. They went to have their turn, but were immediately bewildered. They had no idea what to do, so they just picked randomly. This continued for many turns. They couldn't parlay this rainbow of options into any kind of concrete strategy, so they just "collected stuff", because more stuff is obviously good, and that's all they could deduce.

Make the options in your game (whether they be cards, board spaces, or any kind of option) as distinct as possible. Give them a distinct purpose, and make them achieve that purpose to a significant degree. Avoid options that grant the player a basket of advantages. One "variety pack" space, with lots of different goodies, is fine though.

A player should be able to see a clear and obvious path to their objective, and take an action that points strongly in that direction.

One of the locations in my prototype was the Karate Hall. You could go there and pick up three Attack cards. This location was unusual, in that it was focussed. It was actually the most useful location in the game. When you decided you wanted to attack someone, you went to the Karate Hall, and got exactly what you needed — Attack cards. After that, all the locations in my game were changed to be like Karate Hall.

A more important feature of distinct options is that they give players control over their strategy. They can easily get the tools they need. The skill is in choosing their grand strategy, not in trying to scrape together and manage incremental amounts of resources to fund it.

Distinct options, which do one thing, might be less interesting on their own, but they make for vastly better gameplay. Actions should only overlap in function, with good reason.

================================================================================

Information Overload
Consider the amount of stuff that's going on, in the game. A player should not have to read ten cards, twenty tiles, and thirty board spaces, in order to understand what's going on.

Keep it Simple
Try to keep visible information to a minimum.

In some complex games, working out what's going on is half the mental challenge. I want the challenge to be the strategy, not comprehending the game.

I once played a Magic knockoff. I drew my first hand of seven cards, and each card had many lines of text. Amongst those many lines of text was even more complexity, as there were jargon words in there, that weren't self-explanatory. Also, the game was cooperative. I needed to read and understand not just the cards in my own hand, but those in the hands of all my teammates as well.

Caverna has a large number of board spaces that players can go to. These are mostly self-explanatory. In addition to this, however, there are 48 building tiles laid out. Better read all of them right at the start of the game, so you don't miss something! Don't worry, though. By your 10th-20th game, you'll have a good grasp of these tiles. There's even a handy "introductory game", with only 27 tiles visible.

Information is much more acceptable when it builds up over time, however. 

Aesthetics
There's also an "ugh" factor, that puts people off, the moment they see the game. If a game looks complicated, people will be less likely to want to play it. And, if it's too late for them to get away, it's feelbadness, before the game has even begun.

A simpler game also just looks nicer.

In my gangster game, I kept increasing the number of location cards on the table, and eventually there were twenty. I needed to do this for gameplay reasons, but it was a serious information overload problem. I decided that the top and bottom five locations would be the same every game. That doesn't help with the first game, but it does afterwards. I colour-coded all location cards by function. I redesigned all locations to be simpler. No location could have more than two icons, or more than one line of text.

Reducing information overload
Half of what your game is communicating should be done with icons, not text.

Even then, your game shouldn't be covered in icons. 

Cards should be simplified, and the player should have the least number of them possible.

Group similar pieces of information together.

A Feast for Odin has 61 different actions a player can take on their turn. However, rows of actions are clumped together, with a label like "Crafting" or "Hunting" next to them.

Try to just have one central board or play space, not different areas of cards and tiles. This isn't possible for all games, but it's a good objective. If you have a card row or a group of tiles that's the centre of the game, that's fine. Things that players don't need to read, like resources, decks, and cards that they can't choose to take, are also fine. They can just sit there, and be ignored.

My farming game had buildings you could purchase. There were about ten of these, on the table. I made them into a deck of cards, and dealt each player two at the start. This was mainly done to add variability, but it got those things off the table.

interlinking.md
================================================================================

daniel.games
Interlinking
This is important.

I want to talk about what I call "linkages". This is where parts and sub-parts of a game connect to each other in a big web. These are the key to interesting strategy in games. Let me explain.

Examples
If a mechanic is a self-contained mini-game, it can be easily solved by the players, or it's random and no strategy is possible.

An example:

My orc attacks your orc. I roll a die, and if it's higher than your defence, your orc dies.

If you don't interlink, your systems are just self-contained, and either easily solvable, or just totally random. Or, you end up with scissors-paper-rock, prisoner's dilemma, or other known and basic problems. This means the rest of the game has to be that much more strategically interesting, because your boring core isn't pulling any weight. If you can't interlink, then your game probably doesn't have enough systems.

This is the key to creating strategy in games.

You also need to interlink out to something complex, or your puzzle will still be solvable.

Now, let's interlink.

My orc attacks your orc, and kills it. To do this, I must also discard two cards from my hand.

This interlinks combat into the game's card system. It's an interesting trade-off, without an obvious answer. I'd need to know the exact value of the cards, which is probably too complicated to work out.

Another example:

My orc attacks your orc, and kills it. My attacking orc returns back to his home village, in a different part of the board.

This one interlinks combat into the game's spatial system. Maybe you need the orc in this part of the board, and there are other things for him to do. Again, this creates an interesting choice.

Many games revolve around a giant interlink between two systems, and it works. A typical combination is to have one part of the game be spatial, while the other is a competitive resource-gathering area that isn't spatial.

In Agricola, the systems are the competitive central task board, and each player's own farm, which is spatial.

Eight-Minute Empire is a stark example of two interlinking systems. Players simply take a card from the card row on their turn, and follow its instructions. These cards move their armies around a board, or create new armies. Gaining control of the board gets the player points. However, these cards also have a colour, and picking many cards of the same colour awards lots of points at the end of the game. This simple interlink creates an unsolvable problem, and therefore an interesting game. Do I take a card, to help me take over the map, or to try to collect a certain colour?

Biblios is a good game, but it lacks proper interlinking at the start of the game. On your turn, you draw five cards, but one at a time. You choose one to keep, three to give the other players, and one to put into a future auction. The problem here is that the strategy is too simple, and solvable — as you go through the five cards, you just take a good one (or an average one if you're near the end of the five cards.) There's an interlink out to the game's coloured-card collecting system, but you don't have any other cards yet, so that interlink doesn't do anything.

Yahtzee has the same problem, early on. The moves are fairly obvious. However, the rerolling system in Yahtzee has a lot of internal complexity, so it can survive reasonably well without a proper interlink.

Core systems
A properly-functioning core is essentially a mechanic or groups of mechanics that are too complex for the players to completely figure out. The play of the game is the players doing their best to figure this system out, as much as they can.

A core is usually composed of two or more systems, which are interlinked. Some games hide information (such as a hand of cards), creating a statistical calculation that's too complex to solve. One of the systems could be a complex human system, such as psychology, negotiation, or physical dexterity. Interlinking to these will create huge depth.

Scrabble interlinks a spatial system and the dictionary, both of which are highly complex. The result is a game I've been playing for decades

longTermStrategy.md
================================================================================

Long-term Strategy
Each turn should be a step in a larger plan, not a self-contained puzzle. 

tie turns together
Just as it's important to tie game systems together with interlinking, you should also try to tie turns together, into a bigger, unsolvable game.

You want players intuiting a long-term plan, not just getting the most benefit in a series of self-contained turns.

Permanent benefits make the players plan long-term. This is another benefit of ramps.

Delayed effects of all kinds are also good. Delays might seem strange or bad, but they strongly tie a turn into the following turns.

In Radlands, you can play "event" cards. Each one has a "time" value, and will take that many turns before its effect occurs. Also, when you put a person onto the table, you can't use their ability that turn.

"Money" is almost always a good thing. It should probably be in your game. And, make sure to include some expensive things in your game. Buying something big is also a "big move". Just letting players save up, is a very easy way to tie the turns together.

Anything that lasts beyond the current turn is good.

Sequential actions or a smorgasbord
Multi-stage actions are another way to tie the turns together. If it simply takes multiple turns to put all the pieces together, players must formulate a larger plan.

In Agricola, you just farm crops and animals, to produce food for your people. However, each of those two things is broken down thematically into many steps. To eat crops (efficiently), you need to get a grain token, plow a field, plant the grain in the field, wait for the harvest (whereupon you gain grain), get resources, buy an oven, and then bake the grain into bread. This very sequential gameplay means that you have to do the whole sequence, to gain any benefit. This makes Agricola a much more unforgiving, tense, and strategic game than most games in its category.

Hands of cards
Hands of cards do all kinds of good things, and should be present in most games. They can be great for long-term strategy. Just make sure the cards don't come and go too quickly.

Race for the Galaxy is a great game, but I think it leans a bit too heavily on the tactical side. To play cards, you pay for them by discarding other cards. This too often means that you're discarding your entire hand. This breaks the connection between turns.

You don't want infinite long-term strategy, by making everything too calculable. For most games, a steady drip of a new card per turn keeps this in check.

If you want to make the game have more long-term strategy, turn that drip off, and give players new cards only occasionally.

In Libertalia, players have a hand of nine cards. Each is a pirate ship crew member. Each player plays one of these cards face-down onto the ship, then they're turned over, and they interact, in amusing ways. Many also interact with the characters the player has previously played, which helps tie the turns together even more. New cards are only drawn at the start of each round, which forces a player to plan out all their turns in the round.

pace.md
================================================================================

daniel.games
Pace
When I play a game, I want to feel like each move achieves something, and that the game is going somewhere, not just repeating itself.

Examples
Make sure the game is changing at least a bit, between a player's turns. You may need to speed your game up to many times its original speed. This is fine. I play far too many incremental games, where nothing ever really changes.

In my city-building game, you gather resources from the board, take them to a building to convert them, then spend the converted resources to buy something. Originally, the game's pace was too slow, because there would usually be two turns of gathering resources, two turns of converting resources, and then a turn to buy something. The two turns of doing the same thing, without any change in the game state, were procedural and boring. I made all the conversion buildings vastly more powerful — seemingly unreasonably powerful — so that players would only need to gather, convert, and build. This was much more fun.

In a prototype I played recently, you fight monsters around a city map. They have 3-5 health points each. On a typical turn, I'd reduce a monster's health by one. It took around five turns just chipping away at one monster, in order to kill it.

In this example, nothing is changing from turn to turn. It takes five turns to achieve something. You might say "But having five monsters with one health is the same as having one monster with five health." No, it's not the same. The five monsters will die off, as they're attacked, thereby changing the board, and they might move, or be in some relevant formation on the board. The player might have to think, move around, and reassess their strategy between fighting them.

Progress
It might seem like this is all relative. How can all moves be made more significant?

Let me make it clearer: each action you take should move you a significant way through some game system. It's not a numerical matter, or a question of balance. It's about giving the player new strength or discovering new stuff each turn. That's fun and rewarding.

In my gangster game, you do damage equal to the number of gang members. This starts at 0, 1, or 2. If you gain gang members, you'll probably gain another 2. That makes you way more lethal to the opponents. There's also "rep" which wins the game when you have 10. You can gain 2 or 3 at once. That's huge progress towards victory.

If a system is just a simple score, and there are a few different scores, then you should probably be able to achieve the maximum in that score with a few actions. If it's a deeper game system, the player could progress through it more slowly.

Adjusting Pace
Think about which part of your game is the best. The start, the middle, or the end? Speed up or slow down your game, so that most of the game is about that part of the game.

In my farming game, players' farms were going crazy near the midpoint, so I slowed the pace down a lot, and now the craziness is right at the end, where it should be. It feels good to achieve abundance, and then the game ends a few turns later.

Supercharging
How fast should your game be? It my opinion, you should blast through all your game's content as fast as possible. If that makes your game half an hour instead of an hour, that's an added bonus!

I call this supercharging. Reduce the cost of everything by half.

At one point, I made the cards in Radlands cheaper. Almost all the cards' costs were reduced to 1. It was shorter, punchier, and more alive.

Player Count
A game that supports a larger range of player numbers will appeal to more people, and will more easily get published.

5
Your game should support 2-5 players, if possible. Most games get very slow with five players. If it's a heavier game, just stick to 2-4.

Also consider manufacturing costs. If each player has lots of personal components, a game might top out at four players, instead of five. Four is the minimum for a normal game.

Your game is going to be very hard to playtest if it doesn't work with two players. 2-4 should be your default range, but see if you can add 5.

4
You should support 4 players, unless you have a good reason not to. Getting a game published is harder if it doesn't. I've done it. The most important — and normal — range is 2-4. It's also fine to do just 3-4, if your game has trading or voting, for instance, and doesn't work at 2.

6
6-player games are so slow that they shouldn't be made, without designing the game around them. The game turns should be super-fast, or highly-interactive (such as in a trading game.) Alternatively, they could be team-based, or have simultaneous turns (or no "turns" at all.)

3
Scaling isn't an exact science. The game will be somewhat distorted at different player counts, regardless of what you do.

For standard 2-4 player games, I try to optimise for 3 players, so that 2 and 4-player are both close to the mark.

2
If your game is very adversarial, just make it a two-player game. Don't sacrifice the gameplay, to add players. Two-player-only games are harder to sell, but do what's right for your game regardless. I wouldn't design a game that requires any other specific number of players, however.

I was having significant trouble getting Radlands published, and some publishers were telling me that they weren't interested in a two-player-only game. I added modes for 1 to 4 players, even though it was really a very adversarial two-player game. Roxley liked my game, and agreed to publish it. I brought up the 1-4 player modes I'd added. They said that sometimes it's best for a game to just support the player counts it's intended for. They hadn't done this with their game Santorini, which was really just a two-player game.

I replied "Oh, yeah. I played that game, with three players. Then, I went and rated it 5/10 on BoardGameGeek!"

1
A small number of players will want to play your game solo.

Unless your game is designed for it, I don't think a solo variant is worth your time.

I had some ideas about 1-player rules for Radlands, but never did anything with them. The fans of Radlands came up with solo rules that are probably much better than anything I could throw together. 

Regardless of the player count, design for two-player first, so you can playtest. Then, add more players later on.

Player Interaction
Games are less interactive than they used to be. This is a good thing. Grinding the other players into dust is not what most players want.

However, some recent games have too little interaction, and each player is really just doing their own little puzzle.

If you can't think of an appropriate way for the players to interact, you can't make the game.

Resource Pools
As far as I'm concerned, there's a minimum level of interaction a game needs. Things like competitive "objectives" are not sufficient, because they don't actually affect the players.

A shared central resource pool is just enough, but players should be able to understand and affect the other players, through this pool. Otherwise, this interaction just randomly affects the other players. I call this "resource pool solitaire". It's like a group of people playing basketball in the same area as people are playing chasey/tag. They bump into each other, and affect each other's games, but not in any intentional way.

In Sagrada, each player builds a pattern out of dice. The player wants to organise the colours and numbers of the dice in certain ways, to get more points. It's very thinky. Each player takes their dice from a central pool, but players have no idea what the other players will take, or why. You just hope no one takes your dice. I like the puzzle, but this level of interaction is too low for me.

In Azul, each player builds a tiled floor out of coloured tiles. These tiles are taken from circular "display" boards in the middle of the table. Players need to think about what tiles other players will take, and take those tiles before anyone else gets them. Also, players won't want to let a big pile of the same-coloured tile build up, because an opponent will likely snaffle them up.

In Agricola, untaken resource tokens simply keep piling up. In general, I'll just focus on my own thing. However, if there's a pile of ten wood tokens on a space, I'll really start thinking about how long I can let it build up, before someone takes it.

Resource pools are acceptable, but they're an easy and overused form of interaction. Try to do something better, or create an interesting resource pool.

Tight card pools
I'm increasingly fond of what I call "tight card pools". This is a very easy way to add high interaction to a card game. If cards are central to a game, I like to have players both draw from, and discard all cards to, a central pool. (Cards may also enter the game from the deck.) This means players have to think about what cards other players will also want, and also think about which cards they discard and hence make available to the other players.

In one of my prototypes, I have a very tight pool. Most cards are drawn from the central pool. This creates a lot of interaction, and also long-term planning, because players need to find a strategy amongst the cards in the pool. 

Safe zones
Even in highly-aggressive games, some things should be off-limits for interaction. I need some kind of area where I can plan things, and not have them destroyed.

Radlands is very confrontational. You're constantly blowing up each other's stuff, in all kinds of ways. I was asked why I didn't put cards into the game that make the opponent discard cards from their hand. I decided that the player's hand would be untouchable, so that the player could properly plan things there, without interference. These plans could then be put to the test on the table, where the real battle occurs. This also stopped the game snowballing. Your opponent always has a way out, because they've got cards in their hand, that you can't touch.

In general, restrict the interaction to one part of the game.

In one of my prototypes, players build a village. I wanted to make the game more interactive, so I added warriors. However, these warriors are only useful in competing for a set of prize cards. These cards are very significant and useful, however. An enemy with lots of warriors can monopolise these prizes, but they can never go beyond that, and come and burn down your village. This gives this game a good amount of interaction, but lets you largely do your own thing, without interference.

Negotiation, trading & auctions
These highly interactive social mechanics provide more than enough interaction, but they have a huge impact on the play and feel of a game. They make a game very political, and less strategic. Do not include them in your game, unless that's what the game is supposed to be about.

Politics
Politics is where things in the game revolve around the players' relationships to each other.

Politics can easily push aside other forms of strategy, as a player's fate is decided arbitrarily by who the other players choose to attack. "I'll use my dragon to destroy… umm…YOU!" It can also lead to unpleasantness, and accusations of unfairness.

Politics can be one of the most feelbad things in board gaming, if applied incorrectly, which it often is. Many games have aggressive, targeted elements thrown in, on top of a non-political game.

To remove politics, you can:

Make the game two-player-only
For very adversarial games, I like this answer best. It enables you to make the game for the player count it's best for, without forcing it to be something else.

Remove the choice of who to attack
In my gangster game, attacks hit all other players.

In my pirate game, you can only attack someone on the same space as you. You could technically travel to any player, but you'd need a logical reason to do so.

Provide a benefit for attacking
Make attacking about theft, not just beating down the opponent.

In my pirate game, you attack someone, in order to steal their cargo. Attacking just to hurt them would be far less satisfying.

Tack on a bonus to attacking, so a player will do it for their own benefit.

It's fine that players can choose who to attack. However, if the decision is completely arbitrary, other players can't plan around it. It's simply random and feelbad. Given the opportunity to attack a player arbitrarily, most experienced gamers will search for a reason to choose who to attack, and avoid accusations of unfairness. Attacking the winning player is the usual convention, as it tends to give the attacker the best chance of winning the game.

For less-civilised gamers, politics is an opportunity to hit someone for non-game reasons. The game devolves into a bizarre and unpleasant social metagame, about who likes who most.

Whatever your solution, it needs to make the choice of who to attack be based on more factors than just the whimsy of the player doing the attacking. Even if a player is the victim of such an attack, they'll be okay with it, as long as there was a good reason they were the target of the attack. Also, they will often be expecting the attack, which allows them to plan around it.

Take that!
As with everything in games, a game should have lots of politics, or none. A game should be about politics, or without politics at all. Do not throw small political elements into a game that's largely not political. However, if players are bashing away at each other all game, and the game is about their relationships to one another, that's fine.

Games about politics tend to be the most basic and inane of all designs. Designers who know nothing about design constantly make "take that" games, where the players just play good cards on themselves, and arbitrarily play bad cards against other players. This is an extremely weak and overused format. Don't do it.

Promotion & Demotion
Make elements more or less important in your game.

Promotion
Look through the components of your game, for the best bits. Which things are most fun, or strategic?

Add more of them. However, once you start adding these things everywhere, it's probably time to build them into the game at a higher level. Promote them from being objects, to being their own rule/concept/icon.

In Radlands, cards were initially all just in a row. It didn't matter where you put them. However, I made a Watchman card. He could be placed in front of another card, and the opponent would have to attack him, before they could attack the card behind him. This turned out to be such an interesting ability that I made more such cards that could protect a card behind them. I called this ability "protection". Eventually, I gave so many cards this protection ability, that I promoted protection to be a game rule — every person could protect.

In my gangster game, there are four different-coloured dice you can roll. I made a few locations that allow you to roll two specific dice, see what you roll, and then choose which one of those two rolls you want to enact. Choosing between two die faces on different dice is a very interesting decision, despite it being such a simple concept. I really liked these locations, but there were only six of them — one for each different pair of dice. I decided to promote this "roll two dice and choose one of the rolls" to an icon. It's now a die, split down the middle, with each half being a different colour. Because this is now just a simple icon, I can pair it with other effects, or have two of them on a location. This lets me use this cool effect on a huge number of the game's locations. (I then tried promoting it again, such that all die rolls are these "choice" rolls, but that was too much.)

In my gangster game, I created numerous cards that placed money or health tokens on various locations. Each of these cards had to specify that whoever went to that location got the tokens. Eventually, I just added this as part of the rules, and my cards got a whole lot simpler.

In my gangster game, there are criminal "profiles", that give you a special ability. There are many of these, and you play as one each game. However, there are special power cards that are available in every game. These are important, and I wanted some more of them. I took some of the coolest profiles, and promoted them to power cards. Now, those cool things are in every game.

Demotion
Demotion is the opposite. However, sometimes you have a fun rule, but the game just doesn't need it. Rather than abolishing it, you can just demote it back into a game element, like a card.

In Radlands, you could pay one water resource to rearrange all your people into a new formation. It was an interesting rule, but players rarely used it. The rule was demoted back to being a single, interesting card, called High Ground.

Also, if an effect becomes too rare, it should be demoted.

Radlands had three damage icons — "damage anything", "damage a person", and "damage a camp". After some changes, the camp-damaging icon was present on only two or three cards. I removed it from those cards, and just replaced it with the regular damage icon plus the text "...a camp".

ramps.md
================================================================================

Ramps
A ramp is where the game builds up in some way, as it progresses.

Ramping up
In some games, the activity is complex and interesting enough to be repeated. That's fine. However, most games should ramp up.

If a game doesn't have a ramp, it should probably be a short game. Many of my games are rampless — they just get straight to the action, stay there for a short while, and then end. However, I'd generally recommend having your game ramp up. It's a tried-and-tested approach, and is much easier to execute than a non-ramping game.

Scrabble doesn't have a ramp. In Scrabble, players just repeat the same activity, until the game ends.

In Magic, players play a land card on each of their turns. As the players have more and more lands, they can play bigger and bigger spells.

Ramps are good
Players like going up ramps — building or strengthening or adding to their presence in the game. It's fun and creative, and ties into people's constructive instincts. Players feel like they're making progress.

A ramp progresses the game to its end. More importantly, it keeps the game changing, and it keeps outdoing itself, with bigger and cooler stuff.

It might be tempting to think "this is just going to snowball, and one player will get out of control." Yes, but that's the fun. Seeing whose game can snowball the fastest. Don't make it too simple, of course.

A proper game should have multiple ramps. If there's only one ramp, it's obvious who's going to win, and it's too simple. Give each resource or system its own ramp.

Ramp trajectory
Your ramp should be steep. The bigger the ramp, the better, within reason. Your game should begin with the smallest possible actions, and eventually reach actions that almost break the game. Then, it should end.

At the beginning of the game, a player is weak, and weighed down with restrictions. Through the game, the player gains strength, and overcomes these restrictions. This isn't just good for the game. It's fun and rewarding.

Avoid having your ramp be reversible. It's okay that some things are reversible (such as resources, money, health etc.), but at least one important thing should just go constantly upward.

randomness.md
================================================================================

daniel.games
Randomness
This topic is covered unusually well by other sites, but I'll cover it here, briefly.

Uncertainty
If things are too predictable, players can simply solve your game. That's no fun. Things should be somewhat uncertain.

A good designer adds uncertainty, by using interlinking, hidden information, by and adding interaction between components or players. This makes the game too strategically complex for the players to solve. A player is not entirely certain what they should do, so they need to think about it.

A bad designer just throws in randomness, to create the uncertainty. It does the job, but with a host of downsides — it's often feelbad, disruptive, and anti-meritocratic.

If you're looking for a way to resolve combat or some other small test, use hidden information, not just randomness. If I attack you, I don't roll a die. Instead, you may play a shield card from your hand.

You want players to have some ability to deduce or reason what's going to happen — not total ability or inability.

Input / output randomness
Input randomness gives people randomness, but then lets them do something with it. The most common kind is simply drawing cards. You get random cards, but then you get to use them as you wish, and they have their non-random effect. This allows the player to strategise, and do meaningful things.

Output randomness means that you make your choice, and then the randomness occurs.

In Monopoly, a player draws a card, and something happens immediately. There is no strategy, just random surprise.

Using output randomness
You can use output randomness, but try to remove "bad" outcomes. The best output randomness gives different and interesting results, not good and bad results.

In one of my prototypes, there was very clear output randomness. You could try to use a skill, like Climbing. You'd roll a die and add your Climbing skill score. If the total was high enough, you succeeded. However, if you "failed", you learned from it, and your Climbing skill score increased by one.

Multiple playtesters of the Radlands expansion submitted the "crazy hospital" card idea. This thing might heal your person, or it might kill them. Wacky! This output randomness was really un-fun to play, and out of place in Radlands. I eventually made a version which healed your person if successful, but gave you a refund, and turned your injured person into a punk, if it failed. Punks are okay, so everyone was happy to try out this card, because there was no real downside.

If some results are better, make one or two outcomes stand out by being good, while the rest are mediocre. Don't have any "clearly bad" outcomes.

Even if you have good and bad results, avoid making them "strictly worse" results. This is where one result is equal or better in every way. Three goats might usually be better than two sheep, but three goats is strictly (always) better than two goats.

Randomness is useful
Randomness has some very positive attributes, and most games can benefit from a small amount of it.

Randomness makes each game different.

Chess starts out exactly the same each time, which is less interesting, and allows players to memorise opening sequences.

Randomness means a weaker player has a chance of beating a better player. This means that every game is a serious competition.

I'm an excellent Scrabble player, but anyone could beat me.

Randomness is exciting. Randomness is generally maligned in strategy games, but some games are about the surprise and excitement of randomness. For fun and light-hearted games, randomness is entirely appropriate. Also, if there's constant randomness, it tends to even out.

reducingComplexity.md

Reducing Complexity
Half of game design is game design, and the other half is simplification.

Reducing complexity is one of the hardest and most important parts of game design. It's something that needs to be done to almost every game prototype I see.

Your game is probably three times more complex than it should be. That's been my experience, from the game prototypes I've seen.

Make things work the same way
Avoid adding new systems. Instead, try to create more things within your existing systems.

My games tend to consist of very few systems, but with many things packed into those systems. I then have a reminder sheet that explains what those things are.

In my farm game, there are no separate rules for different things. Everything is just a token you can put on your land. At the end of each round, each token does an effect of some sort. Within that system, I could create pretty much anything. There used to be "lords" who would come to stay. I made them just another token on your farm, and their effect was that you could feed them, and get points. There were invasive bandits, too. They were another token, and their effect was that they'd take over some land.

In my gangster game, you go somewhere, and enact the icons printed on that location. The reminder sheet has a big list of what all the icons mean.

Radlands doesn't have a "combat system". It has abilities, and some of those abilities attack the opponent's stuff. So, combat exists, but as part of the ability system.

In another prototype, cards were the system. You could play cards that did all kinds of stuff. You could attack people too, but that was just another card you could play.

After compacting most of my game into one system, I then try to make those individual things each as simple as possible, or cull those that can't be simplified.

Find things in your game that work in similar ways, and make them work the same way, as part of the same system.

A Feast For Odin has 61 action spaces on the board, for players to choose from. This is an enormous amount, and far too many for most games. However, board complexity is greatly reduced by the fact that almost all the spaces work in just a few ways — largely giving out or converting resources.

the process
I don't worry about the complexity of individual components too much at the start of my design process. It's towards the end of the process that I apply a "bar". It's not a mathematical equation, but every rule and part of the game must add a certain amount of gameplay, per unit of complexity. This causes me to redesign and reword many things, and cut others. This bar gradually creeps up, and by the end of the design, almost everything is simple, and some things are gone.

You want to go over every single thing with a fine-tooth comb, asking "can I possibly remove this text/icon/concept/rule?" You can usually make something half as complex, but 90% as good.

Get rid of anything that creates an exception to the normal rules, unless you have lots of worthwhile things creating the same exception, in which case you should probably turn it into a rule.

Don't add rules 
Never add a rule, in order to fix a problem.

This is a well-known piece of advice.

Instead, create components within your existing rules, that fix your problems.

Radlands had an issue that the game would snowball in the winning player's favour, with one player having a group of people in play that would wipe out the opponent's people, and leave them unable to recover. Rather than add rules to deal with this, I added the cards Radiation and Famine, which kill most of the people on the table.

In one of my prototypes, it was common for players to amass too many cards. Rather than create a rule that set a limit, I just added a little ability on a couple of cards, which forces players with very large numbers of cards to discard some of them. After that, players avoided building up too many cards.

================================================================================
relateability.md
================================================================================

daniel.games
Relatability
Relatability is where something in your game evokes something the player is already familiar with.

The player can relate to the item, event, or character, and they can feel like they're really in the story.

Familiarity
People don't actually want something new. They want to experience something they already like, but in a board game.

You convert the theme into a board game, and maybe put your own twist on it, but it's still that familiar thing.

Radlands was rethemed to post-apocalyptic. Most people love that theme. Now, they can be part of such a world.

You might say that your newfangled and unique theme is actually really good, and it will resonate strongly with the players. That's great, but are you actually going to be able to convey it? Players aren't going to read some irrelevant story from the rulebook. All you have is your artwork and names, and they have to convey the theme alone. It's really hard to teach players a whole new lore with just art and card names. They'll just see random names and artwork, and ignore it.

Magic's card sets strongly evoke things you already know — stories, themes, countries, and real history. How about ancient Japan world, with ninjas? How about an Indiana Jones type of adventure world? How about a world based on children's fairytales?

Tap into lore the players already know and love.

The Radlands expansion had a card called "bivouac". Unfortunatelly, half my playtesters didn't know that word. Some even thought it was "bio-vac". It had to change.
Known things
Your game objects should represent things the player already knows. You give a card or object a relatable name (and later, the publisher does matching artwork.)

However, this is only half the picture. The object has to actually behave like the real thing in the play of the game. The mechanics must match the theme/name of the object.

Radlands is full of such cards. There's Wounded Soldier — an excellent warrior, who starts out damaged, and you have to heal him, if you want to use him. Cult Leader sends your other people off to their doom, to destroy the opponent's stuff. Catapult lets you hurl your own people. In game terms, it destroys one of your people, and can hit anything. This matches the theme closely.

Connecting theme and function is key to immersive gameplay. If you can't do this, because your game rules are too simple, it means you need a smaller and less pretentious theme.

Also, a relatable card or item isn't just cool, it also helps people understand gameplay. A new player might be introduced to a lot of new things, but if those things work in obvious ways, it will be much easier for them to remember. An axe that cuts down trees, and gains you wood, is relatable. The Charm of Kroznor that swaps two resources for one other resource, is not relatable. (Be careful not to get it mixed up with the Charm of Grozbat, which rearranges the top four cards of the deck!) 

Names
I don't like creative names.

Radlands uses very simple names, like Scientist, Exterminator, Holdout, Sniper, Arena, and Blood Bank. These names all tie in closely to the actual function of the cards.

Some names have to be strange, because there's no simple and good name that matches the function of the card (or other game object).

However, my policy is that as many names as possible should be a "real thing". This could mean something that exists in the real world (like Catburglar, Mosh Pit, or Flamethrower.) This could also mean a known fictional thing (like Portal, Time Travel, or Magic Wand.)

If it's two words, they should be a known phrase, not simply adjective-noun. (Rabid Dog and Fuel Tanker are good. Silver Axe and Immortal Angel are not.)

Give all your cards (or other pieces) relatable names, but also work backwards from the theme. Come up with the best-known and most thematic characters, items and events, from the theme of your game. Then, make cards from them.

Magic made sets of cards set in a gothic horror world. They filled these sets with cards designed backwards from the theme. The set was full of relatable cards like Bump in the Night, Cellar Door, Boarded Windows, and Jar of Eyeballs. They introduced double-sided cards, so that some townsfolk cards could "flip over" to a werewolf side at night.

A useable theme
Most things in your game should be entities: people (or other characters), places, and objects. These categories are categories full of well-known and relatable things. You can certainly use actions, events, and concepts as well, but they're much harder to make relatable and different, than entities are.

In Lords of Waterdeep, you gather adventurers, and complete quests. These quests are unrelatable nonsense like "Protect the House of Wonder" and "Establish Harper Safe House". I would've themed these to be different monsters that you fight, not "quests".

In my gangster game, I gave each player a "Big Dreams" card, which was a unique and expensive thing that only they could do. I later changed this to each player having a "criminal profile". They could be a catburglar, a biker, a scientist etc. These were people, and they were much more relatable.

I've played many game prototypes about elemental magic duels. Everything is some variety of abstract spell of some sort, and it's all meaningless.

In Star Realms and Space Base, the cards are spaceships. Each card's theme only loosely relates to its mechanics. They have no character, and they all seem similar.

Wingspan is a hugely successful game about birds. However, it's just a pretty theme. It's almost impossible to connect hundreds of different birds to their abilities. What's a Canvasback anyway? (Seemingly some kind of duck.) And why is its ability "all players draw a card?"

When and Where?
If your game is about people and places, those people and places come from some place and time.

The real world is where you'll get the most relatable stuff. However, the real world is fairly limiting.

My gangster game fits perfectly into the real world. It uses so many real life places, and gangster tropes. It's my most relatable game.

Sci-fi is probably my next choice. It sacrifices some relatability, but isn't limiting.

Early on, there was a suggestion that Radlands could be WW2-themed. But how could I make dozens of clearly-different cards in such a world? The Mad Max post-apocalyptic theme was also suggested, and I enthusiastically endorsed it. This sub-genre of sci-fi does violence and destruction very well, and I could throw in wacky science to handle the rest.

Fantasy works, but is massively overused. Fantasy is also fairly unrelatable, except for its historical component, and all the stuff that's been used forever, like orcs and dragons.

Historical settings are a very restrictive version of the present, and are only occasionally appropriate. You would usually want to start with this theme, and build the game around it.

replayability.md
================================================================================

Replayability
How many times is someone going to want to play your game?

You've made a great game, but can you do something to the game, to have it be playable almost endlessly?

Difference
The answer to this question lies in how different each game will be. Some games have relatively simple concepts, that create fairly deep strategy (Chess, for example.) Others are just wildly different each time, because there are so many possibilities. The tile-laying game Carcassonne, for instance.

Others get a bit samey. For those games, you'll want to add a mechanic that makes each game different. Not so different that it doesn't feel like the same game. Just different enough that the player has to rethink their strategy.

Variable Setup
The best way to do this is usually to vary the setup of the game, while leaving the objective and rules of the game the same.

Agricola's "family version" is one example. It's a great game, but after a few plays, I'm doing basically the same stuff — growing crops and/or breeding animals. And here's where Agricola shines: In the full version of the game, each player begins the game with a hand of cards that affect how the game works. For instance, the Berry Picker gives me a free Food whenever I take Wood. Even a few simple cards like this warp the game enough that I need to rethink my strategy every game.

Variable player powers & objectives
This is a common mechanic, where each player has a unique rule, bonus, or objective for the game. "This time, you're the Romans", or "This time, you're the Doctor." These add replayability, but only as much replayability as there are different powers. A game with six different player powers just lets players play six different ways, and no more.

Multiple variable factors
The key to adding replayability is to have multiple factors that vary. Consider "this game you're the doctor, and your super-power is... invisibility!" Each of the variable factors makes a small change to the game, but there are many combinations of factors, that will interact in countless ways.

In Santorini, players move around a 5x5 grid, building towers, piece by piece. The objective is to climb to the top of a tower. To add replayability, there's a deck of dozens of Greek gods. Each player is dealt one at the start of the game, and these cards make a significant change to how the player plays the game. These are interesting and impactful variable player powers, that affect movement, building, interaction with the opponent, and much more. Because each player has a god card, and they interact with each other through the gameplay, the game actually does have multiple variable factors. The god Pan is the same every game, but his strategy against Ares is vastly different than if he's against Demeter. This interaction creates endless replayability.

I know Dominion's cards like the back of my hand, but I still play it. Each game, there are ten different types of cards for sale. This would get boring after a few games, except that the ten types of cards are selected from amongst dozens. Even if only one card were different, the strategy for that game would likely be completely changed.

One source of variability
Despite having multiple variable factors, these should all be limited to one part of the game. For instance, a player could have two different character cards each game, but not one variable card, and a variable board. People want to play the same game again, not have a totally different and unfamiliar experience.

Extra variability should only be added when a game is clearly lacking replayability. Some designers seem to just throw variable setups and powers into every game they make. Only add variability if the game needs it.

Nudge the players
If you provide multiple different paths to victory, the player shouldn't just choose one arbitrarily each game. Some games have many paths, but there's no reason for a player to choose a different one, other than the fact that they haven't tried it before.

If your game has some kind of mini-objective, or some other thing that isn't a player power, give each player one or two to begin the game with, to give them a nudge in a new direction.

Failure to be different 
If your game doesn't have a setup that's variable enough, people will quickly work out the optimal early moves. They'll discuss them, and anyone who reads it won't want to play your game any more.

The game Tzolk'in has only a slight variation in starting resources, and nothing else. Now, almost all players start with one specific series of opening moves.

As much as I'm in favour of replayability, it's not as important as the actual gameplay. Making your game worse, to allow it to be played more times, is self-defeating. Some games are correct to have limited replayability. I'd rather have an 8/10 game that's playable ten times, than a 7/10 game that's playable a hundred times. I can just play the game ten times, and then play something else.

resources.md
================================================================================

Resources
We've all played the game where a building costs 8 Wood and 4 Stone to build. Even the classic computer game Starcraft had two costs — minerals, and vespene gas. Why?

Having these two separate resources doesn't really achieve anything, except making things a bit more complex to afford.

Resource identity
Each resource should have its own fundamental identity, tied to its own system or important game concept.

In our wood and stone example, maybe wood buildings produce resources, while stone buildings are worth points. This actually means something now. As a player, I don't just want to get more resources. I want specific resources, depending on what I want to do. If you have resources that aren't fundamentally different, you should probably merge them. Even in this example, wood and stone are fundamentally both just different building resources. This would be fine, if building buildings was the central part of the game, and each one of those two resources could be given an individual identity within that.

Unless a game is about resource conversion, no resource should be easily and repeatably convertible to another resource.

"Block" is a common score I see in combat games. It reduces damage. Yes, it's different to some kind of damage score, in that it's defensive, but it's so clearly equivalent to the attack score, because both are part of the game's combat system. Also, it's boring. 

In my gangster game, there are four clearly distinct resources. There's health, which keeps you alive, and in the game. There's money, which buys entry into powerful places. There's rep, which wins the game if you get 10, and there are gang members, which cause you to do more damage to opponents. You could argue that your health and the opponents' gang members are related concepts, but they're not that close. The resources in this game all correspond to different systems and concepts.

Wingspan is a great game, but it has its flaws. Some bird cards will let you tuck cards underneath them. Others let you put food tokens on them. However, tucked cards and food tokens are all simply worth one point. These two systems are usually identical. I would've made the placed food tokens usable by lots of other birds, or have some rule difference. Or, I would've just abolished the tucking of cards, and just used tokens some more.

In my farming game, stone is for buying buildings, wood is for expanding your land, food is the general resource, and gold is a special resource that allows you to use a taken space.

scaling.md
================================================================================

daniel.games
Scaling
Scaling is the process by which you make your game work properly (and hopefully well), regardless of how many people are playing.

A map which is suited to five players, might be too big when the game is played with two. With more players, there might not be enough resources in play for everyone to get enough. In a cooperative game with more players, the game objective might be too easy.

Fixing the problems
It doesn't matter if the game plays differently at different player counts, as long as it's still good.

Doing nothing (or just a little bit) can be a very acceptable solution to scaling issues. The best scaling is no scaling at all. Some games can simply be played perfectly well with different player counts, with no special rules.

Boards
If your game has a board, a basic solution is two have a two-sided board — one for 2-3 players, and one for 4+ players.

You can also have your board be in pieces, and flip some of them, based on player count.

The boards in Caverna are cut up into slivers. You flip or remove some of them. There's a combination of board slivers for every player count from 2-7.

Cards
If your game has cards, having to fish through the game's decks, to remove all the cards for other player counts is onerous. If you have to alter the decks, just make it a very small number of impactful cards being added or removed.

As an alternative, you can simply add special text to cards, such that they do something extra or different, if you're in a game with a specific number of players. These are best in games that have "event cards", where a bit of extra text is okay, and the card affects everyone. These variable cards require extra words, but they don't require extra components, or that the players sift through the cards before each game.

Numerically scaling abilities
Overt scaling abilities that say something like "gain wood tokens equal to the number of players" can work, but are a bit "dirty laundry".

In my gangster game, players attack all their opponents simultaneously, by rolling custom dice. In a 5-player game, you have four other people attacking you, and this gets lethal too quickly. I made two faces of the red die a "grenade" ability. This ability causes opponents to lose 1 health if there are 4-5 players, 2 health if there are 3 players, and 3 health if there are 2 players. This was a very easy way to scale the game. The games with more players are still more lethal, but it's still reasonable.

Game length
The game length shouldn't necessarily be multiplied by having more players. Two hours is fine for a two-player game, but players will simply not play the game with five players if it's going to take five hours. You need to drastically cut back the game end condition, or number of rounds, even if it impacts the game.

If a game ends when its components run out, that can be a great way to scale the game length. Just use the same number of components, regardless of player count.

the Simplest Way
For any problem, always start with the simplest solution.

A friend's game involves the players fighting a monster that roams the city. This monster is controlled by a deck of cards that move it, and cause it to attack. Each turn, the players draw a card, and follow its instructions.

You might imagine all kinds of cool things to put on these cards. The monster might move different combinations of two directions. It might change direction when it hits a wall. It might move, then also destroy stuff or attack. None of this is necessary. This is all just complication and work for the players, and it adds nothing to the gameplay.

The monster just needs to function properly, so the players can combat it. It can be a rampaging and mindless Godzilla. It doesn't need to be some super-strategic ninja, whose antics occupy half the game time.

The correct answer here is the simplest one. The cards should just say "The monster moves one space west" or "Everyone on or adjacent the monster loses 2 health."

You then design the rest of the game to work with this simplicity, rather than using complexity to solve problems. If the monster isn't doing enough damage, because it's not attacking enough, you increase its damage. If you're annoyed that it hits the edge of the map, you just add an occasional "teleport back to the middle" card, so that wall-hitting is rare.

A bad designer simply lets out their belt, and adds complexity.

Avoid creating rules
The rulebooks for my games tend to be about one or two pages long. This is because I avoid creating rules. People are surprised by how simple the rules of my games are.

Simple rules let players start playing immediately. They can devote their intellect to formulating a strategy, rather than to wrapping their head around the rules. It's just a much nicer experience to play something simple.

Avoid creating rules for certain conditions and times.

Imagine you're creating a dungeon-exploring game. What if there are no monsters left in the dungeon? You might create a rule that adds a monster. What if too many monsters end up on one space? You might create a rule that separates them, or a rule that says they can't go onto the same space. A great designer deals with these problems without rules. They construct the game in such a way that these problems never happen. I can't tell you how to do this, only that you must do it.

Spatial Systems
Spatial systems are usually boards made of spaces or squares, that players move pieces around. However, there are many degrees of spatial systems.

What is a Spatial System?
A spatial system is actually a repeated pattern of relationships between all the spaces on the board. This creates enormous intricacy in the game, but it's also easy to understand, as players easily understand which spaces are adjacent. This means spatial systems have an extraordinary Depth:Complexity ratio.

Chess, Go, and Scrabble are games that players can spend a lifetime playing. It's no coincidence that they all have a spatial system.

Beware
Many designers (myself included) instinctively try to represent our theme as it is in the real world — a spatial environment. 

However, spatial systems have profound consequences for a game. This includes a plethora of hidden downsides. I've fallen into many of the traps created by using a spatial system, that I simply didn't understand at the time.

You should ask yourself if your game could possibly work without a spatial system. It might sound strange to abstract physical space away like this, but I strongly recommend you do it.

When Through the Ages was released, it was touted as being "just like the computer game Civilization... but without a map". I was as incredulous as anyone, but it really does work.

Spatial systems typically require a board, and pieces, which adds significantly to a game's component costs. Spatial systems can also add vast rules complexity and information overload.

1D Spatial systems
If you do want to use a spatial system, consider using a simpler spatial system, such as 1D (a line or loop), rather than a full 2D one. A 1D spatial system is still a significant game component.

Radlands has a fairly simple spatial system. You play cards into the table. These are in a grid of nine. The location of the columns doesn't matter, but in each column, the cards in front protect the cards behind. It's three very small 1D spatial systems.

A very common 1D system is the "card row". Players can buy cards from the card row, but the cost of a card is determined by its position in the row. The cards at the start of the row are cheap or free, while those at the top are most expensive. When a card is bought, everything above it moves down, and a new card is added to the end. This keeps the prices of cards moving, so players constantly have to evaluate when a card is cheap enough to buy.

In Boss Monster, players build a 1D dungeon. It's a line of Room cards. The enemy attacks the dungeon, starting at one end, and progresses through the rooms in order (and hopefully not right to the end.)

2D spatial systems: Movement
A 2D spatial system is just a grid (or other pattern) as in Cluedo or Scrabble.

Most 2D games involve movement, where one or many agents move around the board.

In many 2D movement games, access is too limited, and the game is extremely slow. This problem is worst when a player has a single "character" or other piece, that moves around the board. I've seen designers avoid this problem, by increasing players' movement speed across the board. However, this often means that the player can access lots of things, but makes the spatial nature of the board irrelevant, as the player can reach almost any location they like.

In one of my prototypes, players realistically moved around a town full of interesting and thematic spaces. They could move a few spaces at once.

I never understood why this game wasn't good, but later, I realised the spatial system had crippled the players' access. They couldn't do what they wanted. Despite it being very thematic and interesting, the spatial board was just serving as a way to greatly limit the players' ability to do things.

This system also reduced the pace of the game to a crawl. Players wanted to do something, but had to spend four turns walking across the board, to get there.

You will likely also need to include rules for "range" in your game. Even if done simply, this can be complex, and create work. I suggest "range" be limited to two spaces away, if you must have it. Anything more, and players can't work it out easily enough.

To create proper access on a 2D board, you can simply have a large number of agents per player. War games tend to do this.

Of course, you can have a very small board.

In Santorini, the board is only 5x5, and each player has two movable workers.

Even with multiple movable agents, they'll likely need to start very spread out, or the game will begin with five turns of "going for a walk".

Chess, with sixteen pieces per player, has significant access limitation at the start of the game, but this phase is brief, and consequential. 

Incentivise movement
Give the players a reason to move around the board. I want to have to survey the board, and factor my location into my plans. That's interesting. 

I've played many prototypes where I just move to the enemy, and then stay there, thus making the spatial system irrelevant.

Harder still, you want the player to keep moving around the board. Why won't they just stay in one spot? What stops them using a particular area repeatedly? These are hard problems.

2D spatial systems: Placement
Placement is a much safer way to use a 2D board. This means placing more and more pieces onto the board, rather than moving them around.

In Blokus, players place Tetris-shaped pieces on a grid, but they can (and must) connect each subsequent piece to the corner of a piece they placed previously. The player who gets rid of the most pieces before the board clogs up, is the winner. Blokus uses a full 2D system, but is a very light game.

Placement only makes thematic sense for a minority of themes, but it's vastly easier to design around, mechanically. It also tends to have very good access.

Placement allows full access to the board, and it doesn't require (often complex) movement or range rules. The shapes and spatial relationships formed by these pieces can be made to matter, and can be the core of the game. Fitting jigsaw pieces together can be fun.

There are some great medium-light games that combine object placement with a simple scoring system.

2D placement is also a kind of accumulation, which is good for games.

Stay away
If you have a 2D spatial system, then the game is about your spatial system. Don't consider it to be some minor feature.

I strongly suggest almost everyone avoid spatial movement systems.

My attempts have all failed, and I've been designing games for many years. If you have to make a "map" or landscape as your board, don't make it spatial. Just let the player go anywhere on their turn.

Ways to MAke Spatial Movement Work
You give the player their own tableau of options, or lots of cards. They have plenty of things to do, and their position on the board is of very low importance. This makes for a strange kind of a game, but it can work. I call this the travelling musician — he can play his music wherever he is.

In Clank! in Space, you move around a spaceship. However, there are only a few types of rooms. This means you can probably get to the kind of room you're looking for fairly easily. The whole game arc is a voyage into the depths of the ship, and then out again, which forces players to keep moving. The focus of the game is the deck-builder part. After you move, you buy new cards for your deck. This is completely unrelated to where you are in the spaceship. All together, this makes this 2d movement game work.

tension.md
================================================================================

daniel.games
Tension
Tension is where the game is at a crucial moment, and there is much to be gained or lost. Every move matters. This makes for very exciting games, if done correctly.

For there to be tension, there must be risk of loss (or of missing out on something great.) But how severe should this loss be? It shouldn't be "who cares?", nor should it be "I'm doomed." If the player suffers this loss, or misses out, they should have to change their strategy, to deal with it. That's my preferred amount of tension.

In train route-building game Ticket to Ride, you're collecting cards, in order to build routes. However, in many places, only one player can build a route. Another player could build there before you, at any moment. If that happens, you'll have to take a longer path. This is a good level of tension.

You probably don't want your game to be too cutthroat.

Agricola and Caverna are both best-selling farm-building games. In Agricola, there is a sequence of steps you need to take, in order to prepare for each of the regular harvest phases, so you get enough food. Get it wrong, and your people will starve, and you've probably lost the game. It's very tense.

In Caverna, there isn't really a sequence of steps, that could go wrong. You can just get stuff to eat. If someone takes it, you can get something else. You don't need to cook things, so you can't be left with inedible food. Most people prefer the low-tension Caverna.

CLIFFHANGERS
In adversarial games, make the players extremely vulnerable.

In my gangster game, players battle to the death. Originally, players started on ten health points. They'd casually attack each other for a while, reducing each others' health, but it didn't really matter. However, once players got to five health or below, they could die at any time. A cliffhanger battle ensued, as players desperately tried to save their last few points of health.

I changed the rules. Players now start the game on half as much health. You can literally be eliminated after one turn. Choose your move carefully. That's what I call tension!

In Radlands, the cards are so destructive that you can be half-destroyed in one turn. You must race to deal with the opponent's people immediately, or they'll ruin you.

Competition
In competitive games, make only one bundle of each resource available.

If someone takes a resource, it should mean that other players should have to wait to get that resource again, or they should get much less of it.

In most worker-placement games, if someone takes what you want, you'll have to wait for the next round, when their worker leaves, so you can take it. I wanted my farming game to have much more tension than other games in its genre. In my game, the workers never leave. When someone takes the horse, or the cabbage, no one else can ever get them again.

Deadlines
Keep constant time pressure on the players. Add in deadlines. This can be an impending punishment if they don't achieve something, or an opportunity that can be seized.

In my farm game, the players had objective cards, which would award points if completed by the end of the game. This wasn't very tense, so I let the players complete them at the end of any round, for vastly increased points. Now, the players are always rushing to try to complete their objectives before the end of the round.

terminology.md
================================================================================

daniel.games
Terminology
Use simple language and terminology. You're just trying to help players understand the game.

Remember that even when you use simple terminology and wording, people will still fail to understand things. They'll assume things work in ways that would be clearly overpowered, they'll imagine rules that aren't there, and they'll sometimes just fail to read sentences. Don't make this even worse, by using complex wording and terminology.

The Radlands camp Reactor says it "destroys all people". I get people regularly asking if "all" is both players' people, or if it's just the opponent's people.

Words not to use
Do not use jargon for existing concepts that have an ordinary English word for them. Your deck is just a deck of cards, no matter how much you try to spice it up, by calling it the "archive", "spell book", or "army".

Create jargon when you create a new entity, such as a second deck. However, your jargon should be minimally creative. Its overwhelming objective should be that the greatest number of people correctly understand it. Use whatever word fits that objective best. Tell people a concept, and then ask them what they'd call it.

I like to use neutral terms like location, person/character and board wherever possible. This is even more important when you have varying types of that thing. I don't want to have to remember which guys are "allies", which are "mercenaries" and which are "heroes".

However, you should avoid using known concepts, from classic games. This includes words like joker, wild, and run. These are themeless and immersion-breaking, reminding the player that they're actually just moving bits around, and not participating in an exciting world.

In Egypt-themed Egizia, there's a worker with a white skirt. He's the only worker that can add his strength to another worker. The game calls him the "joker". When I teach people the game, I call him the "helper". It's far more explanatory, and is thematic.

My publisher renamed Radlands' locations to Camps, and citizens to Punks. These added theme, while not being confusable.

Do not include Magic terminology like target (something of your choice), resolve (happen), or Dungeons & Dragons terms like 3d6 (three six-sided dice.) Don't say things like "active player" or "orthogonal" (adjacent, but not diagonally.) Game enthusiasts know these terms. No one else does.

Remember that things like resolve (happen), search your deck, and reveal a card, are unknown concepts to many people.

Many things don't need a name
I avoid the terms supply and bank to refer to unused tokens or resources. People don't need to be told that unused pieces should just sit in a pile on the table, and they know that when they gain something, they get it from that pile (not from another player, for instance.)

Do not create a named "zone" for everything, that you refer to, and that players will need to remember. Things can just be "in play" or "on the table" instead of "in the battle zone". Cards on the table, but not in play, can just be "set aside".

Just because Magic calls your deck the library, and your discard pile the graveyard, it doesn't mean you should. Magic is a game with a huge amount of depth and complexity.
Language
As with jargon, the phraseology you use (typically on cards) should simply be that which conveys the correct meaning to the most people.

The Magic card Dead Ringers reads "Destroy two target nonblack creatures unless either one is a color the other isn't." Basically, the two creatures have to be exactly the same colour or combination of colours, and not black. This card is legendary for its incomprehensibility.

You do not get any extra points for being technically correct. Only huge games like Magic need exact terminology, because they have complicated rules, and are always creating new cards.

The Radlands card "Looter" has the damage icon, and then it says "if this hits a camp, draw a card." The word "hit" isn't defined anywhere in the game, but it's obvious what it means. Replacing it with several technically-correct words would be ugly, and cause a small number of players to not understand it.

You can be very conversational in the language you use on your cards, as long as people know what you mean. You can also be redundant.

A camp in Radlands once had the text "You can only use this ability in a turn in which you play no other abilities." Basically, it must be the only ability you use in a turn.

If you analyse it, there are temporal problems with this strange wording. When you use it, you don't technically know whether it's valid to use it or not, as you're not yet sure whether you'll use another ability later in the turn. Technically, the card's text should tell you that you can only use it if you haven't played any abilities this turn, and it should prevent you from using any further abilities this turn. Despite this technical error, everyone understood the card. There was never a problem.

If anyone is failing to understand something, it's your problem.

It's fine to put explanatory text on cards. Just some small, grey text, that people don't have to read, but that people can refer to if they get confused.

Rules Depth
Do not cater to rules pedants, by adding extra text to your cards to make them exactly accurate. Cater to the 99% of reasonable people. I answer Radlands questions all the time, where the answer is obvious, but it would be possible to interpret them diferently.

There's a Radlands camp called Catapult. You destroy one of your own people, and damage one of the opponent's cards. The art shows Catapult hurling a punk through the air. Someone asked me whether the destruction of your own person was a mandatory cost, or part of the effect. If they activated it without having a person to throw, would it still do its damage? Come on.

These days, I tell people quite openly that the rules of Radlands are shallow, and inconsistent. Some questions will have arbitrary rulings that are good for gameplay, or match the theme. Others simply have no answer.

Write game text for ordinary people to understand, not for precision.

Clear purpose
My gangster game contained a card called "Stash". This put two money tokens on the location that the player to your right is on.

Everyone understood what the card did, but no one understood why they'd want to play it. It just seemed wacky and useless.

To me, it was obvious. I play the card, and I put two money tokens under the player to my right. On their turn, they move off that space. I'm the next player around the table, so I'll be the first player who's able to move onto that now-free space, and collect the money.

Even competent gamers didn't understand this card.

The card now has the same text, but at the bottom of the card, there is a small line of text saying: "(Hint: Go there next turn, and collect it.)" Now, everyone understands the card.

theme.md
================================================================================

daniel.games
Theme
If you're designing theme-first, you must choose a fascinating theme. When you tell people the theme, they should immediately be interested.

Players and publishers are not interested in "a pirate game" or "a train game". To a jaded publisher, a game about the sewage system is vastly more interesting than another game about zombies. I kid you not. Your theme should be interesting, but doesn't need to be totally zany. Zany is definitely good though, if you can manage it. If a publisher somehow gets around to evaluating a boringly-themed game, and the mechanics interest them, they'll just retheme the game to something else — of their choosing.

My game Radlands was originally a generic futuristic game, but the publisher changed that to an over-the-top Mad Max theme. It was a huge improvement.

Don't make your game literally ten times harder to publish, by choosing a boring theme. It's ludicrous to have complete freedom with the theme, because you're designing theme-first, yet not actually choose an interesting or novel theme.

Even if your theme has been done before, and you don't want to change it, you can still put a new twist on it. If you have to do zombies (which you shouldn't), make it "zombies in Japan" or "zombie cats" or something.

You can just choose an amazing theme with no relation to your mechanics.

I would've made the game about animals, or something with more variety, but Wingspan's bird theme has helped make it hugely successful.

Feeling of the theme
I'm not really wanting to just evoke the theme itself. The theme leads to a larger feeling of the theme.

I don't just want a pretty, pirate-themed game. I want to feel like a pirate — roaming the sea, attacking other ships at will.

I don't want a spy-themed game. I want to feel like a spy — planning secret moves, and having secret information.

In case this distinction isn't clear, think about some examples from real life for a moment, without thinking about board games.

Imagine you're a kid arriving at a theme park, and there are more rides and activities than you can imagine.

Imagine the feeling of exploring a haunted house.

Imagine you're at the edge of a vast, unexplored wilderness.

Think of a game you really like. What is the feeling you get when you play it, or that you got when you first played it?

Turning a real-life feeling into an actual game is extraordinarily hard, but you only need a small amount of that feeling to come through in your game, for it to make an amazing board game. This is done not by slapping a theme on your game rules, but by carefully choosing game rules that bring out your theme.

Theme size
The size of the theme should also match the size of the game. Do not try to attach a big story to a small game.

Azul is a game about arranging coloured tiles. The theme is that you're making a Spanish tiled floor. That's an appropriate theme.

Codenames is a word association game. It's themed as a game about secret agents. That theme is completely irrelevant to the game.

In a friend's prototype, you place object tiles around cat cards. When a cat is surrounded by objects, you add up the points on the tiles, to see who takes the cat. This game was mechanics-first, other than the very general "cat" theme.

We went through all kinds of big-picture themes for the game. It could be a cat adoption place. But why would you adopt multiple cats, by placing objects around them? I suggested a cat cafe. That was better. However, nothing else in the game said "cafe". We agreed in the end that the story was just that you were having fun with cats. You give them objects, and they like you, and come to you. That was the extent of the story. It was the correct choice, because it matches what the game actually is.

I've seen numerous basic number or colour-matching games, with some kind of epic legend as a theme. Don't just pick the most awesome theme you can think of. Find whatever matches your game best.

Leave your theme broad, so it doesn't restrict you. Don't choose the exact time period, location, and size of your theme at the start. As you develop the game, your choice of individual cards and resources will help narrow things down.

Single-Player Themes
Some themes are inherently single-player (or cooperative.) If you're exploring a land, or going on a journey, for instance, how is this a competitive game? You can do these themes, but you might need to bend the theme, to explain why the players are competing.

I made a game where the players were trying to survive as shipwrecked castaways. That's an amazingly relatable theme, in my opinion.

I didn't want the mechanic of the players helping each other, so I made the castaways criminals. I didn't want player elimination, so I just decided that you would lose points rather, rather than die, if you failed to sustain yourself. But what is victory, in this game? I decided that the player who survived this experience best (by having the most points at the end) was the winner. This was all a bit strange, but none of it impinged on the feeling of being a castaway, which was well-supported by the other game elements.

The theme needs to be simple and strong
You need to be able to explain your theme in a few words. Telling a long story you invented, is not a theme. It's just a random collection of things.

I'd like to play a game about running an ant colony, or creating a mosaic. I know what those things are, and I want to play them in a game. I'm not so interested in being the Archmage of Kronglor, or recovering the Five Galactic Shards of Kozmog.

People need to be captivated by the theme of your game, and that's only going to happen if they can actually understand it.

I've designed games on all kinds of different themes, and people's reaction was usually fairly muted. Then, I started making a game about kids roaming around a neighbourhood on their skateboards, and getting up to all the mischief that kids get up to. This theme resonated strongly with people, and they were immediately fascinated and engaged by it. If you're designing theme-first, this is what you should be aiming for.

Having said all this, I don't recommend starting theme-first. It's much easier to use a preexisting mechanical framework, that's known to work in other games.

turnStructure.md
================================================================================

Turn Structure
A game turn should be simple, easy, and interesting. It should not be a list of steps and procedures.

After complexity, this is probably the #2 criticism I have of other designers' games I playtest.

This is a huge mistake I see in game expansions. Have you ever felt like a game was simpler and better without its expansion? That extra step each turn/round has a cost.

Phases and actions
A turn should not be comprised of "phases" unless absolutely necessary. Make a turn about a single, consequential action. Remove or minimise everything else.

Turn structure is a very high design priority. Redesign other parts of your game, in order to simplify it.

Work backwards from a simple turn structure.

Simpler turns are easier, but they're also quicker. In my experience, boring games are usually boring because of downtime, i.e. waiting for other players' lengthy and complex turns.

A poor game designer argues the case as to why these steps are necessary. A good designer abolishes them, and then finds other ways to make the game work.

Number of actions
Doing two things on your turn is acceptable. If you can move then attack, that's fine. If you get income, then spend it, that's fine too. For more complex games, three actions is more appropriate — two choices, and one maintenance step. For simple games, you cannot exceed two steps: one choice, plus one small maintenance step.

There's a simple test here, for you and your playtesters: are there parts of the turn that you keep forgetting, don't actually care about, or are a drag? If so, your turn structure is wrong.

In Pulsar 2849, on each turn, each player will place two dice. They'll use this to fly spaceships around, build things, and upgrade technology. This is interesting. However, at the start of each round, there's an extensive and convoluted phase where players choose their dice for the round, from a shared pool of rolled dice. Furthermore, players typically plan out their whole round during this phase, before picking dice.

Limit choice
If a player has to make a choice, they'll take time to think about that choice. They'll do this, even if the choice isn't important.

In my farming game, I had ten little abitilies. Instead of making a space that let you choose three of them, I just bundled them into groups of three or four.
Steps in a turn are bad, but steps with choices in them are far worse.

Try to confine the choices to one part of the turn, and make those choices important. Make the rest of the turn automatic and choiceless.

Don't go overboard in this. A simple and automatic drawing of one card per turn is likely worthwhile.

In my gangster game, drawing one card per turn gave too many cards, so I let players buy one, at the end of each turn. This step now contained a decision, which slowed the game right down. I eventually decided that, if there had to be an extra step, it would simply be to draw one card. This was too many cards, so I made a portion of the deck super-simple, non-functional cards. These "Package" cards can be collected, and delivered to certain locations in bulk, to exchange for resources. These cards have almost no complexity, so a player having numerous packages, and one or two regular cards, doesn't overwhelm them, like a hand of several regular cards would.

The Magic card "Sensei's Divining Top" lets you look at the top three cards of your deck, and rearrange them. Players would use it once or more per turn. Its benefit was small, but required extensive thought. The card was eventually banned.

Do not force the players to discard down to X cards each turn. That's another whole pile of complex but unimportant decisions.

Some tips
All turn options should generally be put into one menu. They should not be a series of different menus of choices. "You may do A or B or C" is much faster than "you may do A or B, then you may do C or not", and offers the player more freedom. For more complex parts of a game, players might pick more than one choice, but it would still be from one menu. Giving each thing a cost works in much the same way.

In Radlands, you can put people onto the table, and you can have them use their abilities. You can use your camps, or use special actions like drawing a card, or playing a special event. However, all these things are in a single step. There is no separate "combat phase". All these things cost an amount of water to activate, and you have three water to spend each turn. Once you've spent your water, you end your turn.

Be careful of giving players options they can do on a turn, but usually don't. These always require thinking, and they can also make it unclear when a player's turn has actually ended.

Another way to simplify your turn structure is to cut your turns up into small bits, and have each bit be a turn. It's better to do half as much on a turn, if it means you wait half as long for your turn.

For simpler games, "rest turns" are fine, wherein you might just draw a new hand of cards, replenish your energy, or the like. This allows you to remove "draw a card each turn" or "gain one energy each turn" from the turn structure, which is often essential for family-weight games.

In Ticket to Ride, a player's turn is either spending cards to build "tracks" on the board, OR taking two new cards. I agree with this structure, especially since the game is fairly light and simple.

Cut out tiny tasks and choices from players' turns.

In Ticket to Ride, there are five train cards, and on your turn, you can take two of them. However, once you take your first card, you draw a new card to replace it, and then you decide which second card to take. This means that you have to consider if you want the new card. This adds a second small decision and a task to the turn. I would've just had the player take two cards, THEN replace them.

Get rid of maintenance
I just want to play the game!

A player's turn should just be about doing the thing (or things) they want to do, plus minimal (ideally zero) maintenance and bookkeeping.

If there are tasks that must be done, to maintain the game state, try extremely hard to move them from the turn to the round.

Putting out ten tokens at the start of a round is fine. Having ten turns, in which the player must also put out one token, is not so good.

Even better, get away from having "rounds" entirely. Rounds tend to exist because a game needs to undergo housekeeping. Does your game really need that housekeeping?

In one of my prototypes, players moved to spaces around a town, that had various effects. Typically, they'd let the player draw some cards.

To stop a player using a spot repeatedly, and encourage them to move around the board, the player put a "depletion" counter on the space when they used it, so it couldn't be used again. I wanted to get rid of this step.

I removed the depletion counters, and replaced them with "stash" counters. These added goodies to certain spaces on the board, to encourage players to move across the board, to get them. I needed far less of them, as just a few stashes would keep the players moving around all game.

After moving, the player would also draw a "Change" card. These cards moved the non-player characters around the board, advanced the time, removed those depletion counters, and caused larger game events to happen. I wanted to get rid of those too.

I put the Change cards into other decks, so they would be drawn occasionally, as part of players' regular turns. After all this, the turn was simply to move, and draw the good cards. Only occasionally, you'd get a card that placed stashes, or did other work. You'd do it, and draw a new good card to replace it.

Player-controlled gameplay
Try to keep game-controlled effects out of the game. Yes, you can have "event cards" that happen periodically, or "neutral players" that perform actions, but does the game need them? If they're needed, make them very simple and quick. Far better to let a player control the "bad guy" momentarily, and use it to attack their opponents, than to have a whole process for deciding what the bad guy does.

In one of my prototypes, I decided that you could get a bad "reputation". But if you had a bad reputation, what did that mean? I could've had neutral characters who would periodically chase you, or detect you and react to you. I decided not to do that. Instead, it's the other players who can target you, and steal your points, if you have a bad reputation. It's far simpler, and requires no maintenance.

Game Weight
Weight is a game's complexity and difficulty of play, though there's no standard definition.

Weight tends to be classified as light, medium, or heavy. As an example, Bridge would be at the heavy end, while Dominoes would be at the light end.

Greater weight means a game is harder to learn and play, and will appeal to far less people.

Lighter games also tend to have less components. This appeals to more people, given financial and space constraints.

Given two otherwise-identical games, the lighter one is superior.

Less work
When developing larger games, each change or problem requires long periods of thought, and there are so many components to update, each revision. It's far less fun than designing a lighter game.

Heavier games are also much harder to design. When a big group of systems just isn't fun, it can be extraordinarily hard to analyse.

Don't design anything above medium-light, until you're onto your 20th design.

At the end of it all, there's no extra reward for designing a heavy game. Likely the opposite is true. Everyone will play a medium-light game. Only a minority of people will play a medium-heavy game.

I regard designing above medium weight to be almost unnecessary. If your game is heavier than medium, I'd be almost certain that it shouldn't be.

Medium is the new heavy.

Medium-light is the new medium.

Who Goes First?
It's a little bit feelbad for one player to have the unfair advantage of going first, but someone has to go first.

It's fine
Assuming you're interested in your depth:complexity ratio, you should seriously consider not mitigating the first-player advantage. The objective of mitigating first-player advantage is to improve the game. Adding unnecessary complexity or strange rules, is often not worthwhile.

How big is the advantage? In a game with many small turns, it's probably not worth worrying about. In a game with fewer turns, where the turns are significant, it's a bigger problem.

Advantage of going first
In a two-player game, the second player will get one less turn in half of all games. So, on average, they're getting half a turn less. You compensate for this, by making the first turn a half-value turn, or by giving the second player an extra half a turn worth of goodies. In a game with more players, the last player should get compensation almost equal to a turn.

Mitigating first-player advantage
The ideal place to apply mitigation is inside the game components themselves, because it's invisible, and adds no complexity.

In Scrabble, there's no special rule for going first, it's just that there aren't many premium squares you can reach on the first turn.

For most games, however, the solution is simple. You find the most basic game resource, and dole it out in differing amounts, based on the player order.

In Lords of Waterdeep, the player going first begins the game with 4 coins, the second player 5 coins, the third player 6, etc.

In Star Realms, players draw a new hand of five cards each turn. To mitigate the first-player advantage, the player who goes first gets a hand of only three cards on their first turn. It's like a mini-turn. Perfect.

My gangster game had two resources: Health and Money. Everyone started with ten health, and some small amount of money. I gave the players, in turn order, 1/2/3/4/5 money tokens, to begin the game. However, this was too much, and 4 or 5 money tokens allowed the later players access to very powerful effects. A turn is only worth about three money tokens. In the end, I settled on a 0/1/1/2/2 system. Slightly more complicated, but still very a fairly simple solution.

However, players 3 and 5 are disadvantaged by this system, as they get the same amount of money as the player who goes before them. So, how about if players three and five got some Health instead of some or all of their money? I could make a combination that's very fair.

This goes too far. Having 11 or 12 Health at the start of the game might be fair, but it makes the strategy of the game different, based on your seating position. It's also rather odd, and is not easily remembered. A player would have to refer to a chart each game. It's not worthwhile.

You should not create something that has an ongoing effect, or that warps the game in some way. I'm not a fan of the "keep going until everyone's had equal turns" rule. That means the effect of going first is something that will persist to the end of the game, and matter again. Fair, yes. Wonky, yes also.

Variable turn order
In round-based games, it's fine for the starting player to change from round to round. This is a very simple and interesting choice you can add to a player's options for their turn. If it doesn't fit in, you can just have a starting player marker move clockwise around the table each round.

Don't use completely variable turn order, where play doesn't go around the table in a circle. This is usually accompanied by this turn order changing every round. This is an annoying and time-consuming mechanic, and people will constantly be getting it wrong, and forgetting that it's their turn. As always, if the game is about the varying turn order, it's perfectly acceptable (Kingdomino, Power Grid.)

The minimal solution
This problem is not an opportunity to stuff in extra flair and complexity. First player advantage is a problem that should be solved with the most unobtrusive solution that works — or not at all.

Winning & Losing
The victory condition of a game isn't as important as it might seem. People just want to enjoy the game.

Points
Some games have a logical end, that ties strongly into the theme.

My gangster game ends when you've eliminated all the other players.

For many games, particularly less-adversarial games, there is no organic end. The game has to end at some point, and the question of who wins should simply be "who did the best stuff?"

In this case, add a points system to the game, that rewards the player for generally doing good stuff. The winner is the player who has the most points at the end.

As with everything, keep it simple. Don't chase mathematical accuracy, at the cost of complexity.

In Century: Spice Road, all spice cubes are worth one point, except for the worst type, which are worth zero. This is a good compromise.

Player elimination
In general, players should not be eliminated from a game. It's not fun having to wait for the game to finish. Especially, don't have players eliminated early in the game.

Elimination can, however, raise the stakes, and create amazing tension. Elimination is appropriate for a small minority of games. Cliffhanger moments can be some of the best moments in gaming. Imagine TV show Survivor, without elimination.

The key to cliffhangers is that the player probably survives each cliffhanger. No more chance, no less.

My gangster game goes for about 20 minutes, but players are injured at fairly similar speeds. If anyone is eliminated, it's likely very late in the game, and there's a good chance many players are eliminated at once, possibly ending the game. The eliminations rely on the luck of the dice, which provides endless cliffhanger moments. When players are eliminated, they typically stay engaged with the game, wanting to see who wins, as the survivors battle it out, on the verge of death.

Tiebreakers
Sometimes, the game is a tie. What happens, then?

I'm okay with a game being a draw. Players find it amusing, and neither player is the loser.

I don't like tying, and then reaching for the rulebook, to see "who really won". Equal performance equals a tie, in my books.

Gameplay aside, I don't think tiebreakers are worth the extra complexity, but many designers insist on having them.

The worst tiebreakers are the random ones.

In Splendor, the player with the most points wins. If players have equal points, the player with the least cards wins. This is simply flipping a coin. There is almost no time at which you should try to get less cards. It only matters in the case of a tie. No one has been focussing on it, and it's essentially random.

Other poor tiebreakers include turn-based tiebreakers. Whoever has had the most turns loses the game. This attempts to fuse two problems together — balancing the starting player advantage, and creating a tiebreaker. However, this leaves a permanent warping on the game, such that the game is slightly different for both players, all the way through. Also, I have to go and check who was first.

Your tiebreaker, if you want one, should be the person who wins by more, or would be in the lead, if the game kept going slightly longer. To find this player, follow the victory chain backwards. If the player with the most houses wins, and houses are bought with gold, then the player with the most gold should win the tie.

Don't create a second tiebreaker, if the first one is still tied. The complexity is not justified. The game can just be a tie 0.1% of the time.

Work
"Work" is where a player must do non-entertaining physical or mental tasks, in order for the game to function.


Work is bad
Keep it to a minimum.

Work that's a regular part of the game turn, is a huge negative. You should consider changing your game significantly, to remove such work. It is not a minor factor.

It's also very easy to forget to do the work, and have to fix up the game.

This includes things like restocking spaces with resources, restocking and advancing a card row, and shuffling/dealing cards.

Setup
Your game should have minimal setup and teardown. Avoid having boards pre-populated with stuff. Have players add the stuff during the game.

I've seen numerous positive mentions of Radlands having almost no setup. You just shuffle and begin. It's really nice.

Some games are adjusted for different player counts, by forcing the players to go through each deck, and remove certain cards. This is common, and should be avoided wherever possible.

When you play Bärenpark with less than four players, it tells you to remove some combination of tiles from each of the piles of tiles numbered 1-7. Do I really have to do that? Would the game be terrible if there were just too many of those tiles? This is in addition to having to arrange all the game's components on a board to begin with.

Ideally, just change the game, so the work isn't necessary.

Isn't it nice to get out a game you can just play? 

Calculation
Yes, it's nice to find an exact mathematical equation that matches your design objectives, but players don't want to do mathematics.

Keep numbers as small as possible. Not everyone is good at mathematics. I can total five dice, or add 16 and 27 instantly. Many people can't, and I would still rather not have to do it.

Halve all the numbers in your game. Does it still work properly? Good. Keep going. You might like the exact ratio of the buildings worth two and seven points, but just make them one and three points, please.

Something in your game should be worth one point. If that's not the case, your point values are too high.

Observation
A player must be observant, to make sure a condition is or isn't being met, or must constantly evaluate known information, such as how much money each opponent has.

The game Dead of Winter contains "crossroad" cards. The player who draws it keeps it secret, and when the secret condition on the card is met, the player reveals the card, and something happens. People like these, but they generate an ongoing and distracting observation task for the players, and a high potential for mistakes.

Counting
Try not to make exact high numbers matter.

In Race for the Galaxy, players must discard down to ten cards in hand at the end of each of their turns. That means every large hand of cards needs to be constantly counted.

Magic's Odyssey expansion introduced the "threshold" mechanic. While seven or more cards are in your discard pile, some bonus effect occurs. This requires that players constantly tally the number of cards in their discard piles.

A better way to do this is to make the number only be counted at certain points, or when certain things happen.

In Catan, whenever any player rolls a 7, all players with more than seven cards discard half their cards. This is much less work than forcing players to discard down to seven cards at the end of every turn.

Scoring
Does your game have to have "point salad", where everything is worth points? Can you make lots of things just be worth the same number of points? Can you just make things worth nothing?

I've dealt with this problem in my farming game. There is no scoring of your farm. You just reveal your objective cards, and add them up.

Memory issues
Memory issues are where a player must remember something. This might be in order to make the game function properly, but is usually just advantageous information that the player should keep a mental note of.

"Look at a player's hand. They discard a card of your choice." That's a decent ability, but the player really should take note of all their opponent's other cards, and keep them in mind. That's not fun, but you're a bad player if you don't.

In Splendor, players can reserve cards from the table, to buy later. However, when they do, they turn the card face down. Players should take note of this likely-important card, but that's mentally taxing, so they don't. Later, the player plays the card, and wins.

I don't like to have to keep something in mind. I just want to think about my strategy. If there's something that people have to be forced to remember, get rid of it. Alternatively, make it something good, that they'll want to remember. Or, make it something big, that they'd notice if they forgot. Or, use a physical component or cue to remind you.

Some games are about memory. That's fine, but most people don't really like memory games.

Once information has been made public, try to keep it public, or throw it away.

Referring
Don't make the players look up data. Everything in the game should be memorisable. This includes game setup.

Cards with text should be self-explanatory. If a normal person will read the card, and need to check the FAQ, the card needs to be rewritten.

Players Must Enjoy Their First Game
The first time someone plays your game, their enjoyment is crucial.

Each copy of your game will be played many times by its owner, but by many other players, once. This is because they're playing it at a games club, or after a dinner. That impression really counts.

People will play your game more than once, but only if they enjoy it the first time. By the end of their first game, they must fully understand the game. Preferably, they understand it very early on, and spend their time strategising, not simply trying to understand the rules.

Personally, I have no time for games that aren't good on the first play. Maybe they're great after ten plays. I'm not going to invest the time to find out. 

Many fans of Radlands have told me that they've had numerous occasions whereupon they've played the game with someone once, and that person bought the game immediately. I was told that one player even stopped playing mid-game, and started using his phone. When his opponent asked him what he was doing, he said he was buying the game online.

Beginner setup
As much as possible, you need to build a ramp for new players, so they can ease into your game. 

Include a "beginner setup", which specifies the setup of the game, for the players' first game. This setup should use not just the simplest game elements, but also the ones that have the most straightforward effects and benefits.

This lets you keep players away from complex or unusual game elements designed for experienced players.

There is no reason not to do this.

In Catan, the players create a random board out of hexagonal map pieces. Then, they take turns placing two settlements on the board. The beginner setup instead has a picture of the setup, and says "set the board up like this, and put the players' settlements here."

In Radlands, there are dozens of different location cards. Each player is dealt six, and chooses three to keep.

For players who haven't played the game before, the rules instruct them to instead use three specific location cards each. This eliminates the pre-game location choice, which is meaningless to them, and it gives each player three simple locations, to ease them into the game. I also biased this set of locations towards aggression and normality, so that the players' first game would more likely be a quick, action-packed brawl.

You can even give players hands of specific cards.

Family version
If your game is very complicated, you should go even further, and create a "family version", where you remove some systems from the game entirely, for the players' first game.

Reminder cards
For all but the simplest games, I always use reminder cards.

A reminder card is a card of very brief rules. It's typically used to display data, not large blocks of rules text.

I use reminder cards to reduce the complexity of my rules, not just to provide information in a handy format for the players.

Allow me to explain.

In my gangster game, there are four unique custom dice. During development, I replaced all the boring "do 2 damage" and "gain 3 health" type of die faces. The game now has fifteen different die faces. I made sure each die face was extra-simple, but fifteen is still a very large number. I put all of these on a handy reminder sheet. The rules for the game are barely a single page, and they just say "start playing now. Refer to the reminder sheet to see what the die rolls mean." Players can start playing straight away, and during their first game, they really do learn all the die faces long before the first game ends.
