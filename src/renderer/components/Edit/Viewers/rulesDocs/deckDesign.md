Deck Design
A deck is a single thing, that serves a purpose. It's not just a collection of cool cards.

Simple
What are the simplest possible cards that could exist in your game? They should exist, because their complexity is super-low, and their gameplay value might be reasonable. Many of your cards should be nothing more than an icon. Most should be one sentence, and maybe an icon. Next, do cards that have two icons on them, or an icon and a sentence of text. Then, two sentences.

Look at every rule of your game, and make a card that breaks it in some way.

Not all of these cards will work, but you should try them.

Straightforward
In addition, most of the deck should be composed of cards that do very straightforward things. They shouldn't be situational or unusual or flashy. They should be things you'd usually want, even if those things are boring on their own. The hand as a whole is what's interesting, not the individual cards.

When players draw a hand of cards, it should be very easy to understand, useful, and maybe have one wacky or exciting card.

A deck is a deck, not a collection of cards. Most of its contents will be boring and functional.

how many cards?
To further simplify the deck, and make it more functional, I skew card decks heavily towards the aforementioned simple & straightforward cards. I put three to five of those cards in the deck, and only one or two of each of the exciting and strange ones.

I try to keep decks as small as possible, especially if the deck isn't the core of the game. You can easily make a deck much better, by halving its size, and keeping only the best half.

Predictability
There's also another axis to consider here: predictability. I like to add strategy to games with cards, by giving the players some idea of what cards the opponent will play. If there are some common cards in the deck, a player can anticipate them, and strategise accordingly.

If the deck is full of unique cards, players won't be able to strategise at all. The opponent's cards will just hit them out of the blue, and it will be feelbad. 

Use a deck
A general piece of advice here: Cards do a lot of good things for a game. They provide choices. They're a well ofrdepth and replayability. They help tie turns together. If the cards are in players' hands, they're hidden information, and which pushes your game away from calculability, and towards intuition.

Most games should have a deck of cards.

Deck construction
Avoid "deck construction" (this is where players can modify or build their own deck before the game.) Many players will not want to play a complex metagame on top of your game. Deck construction also likely requires multiple products, to enable the full spectrum of deck-construction possibilities. It probably also necessitates a community, where you can trade for cards you want for your deck. The vast majority of players don't want to interact this strongly with a game, or do non-game activities. If they do, they can just play a game like Magic, which is designed specifically around that concept. Publishers are also likely to shy away from competing with the giants that already dominate this field.

Just make a normal game.
