Choices
Players want to have lots of interesting choices on their turn, and feel like they're in control of what they're doing.

Choices
A player should have ten things they can do on their turn.

More is fine. Less is probably not. This is such an easy thing to do, so make sure you apply it to your games.

Magic can often lack choices, leading to many "correct turns", with the strategy existing on the other turns. Half the deck's cards are non-functional land cards, and the player's existing cards may not be useful.

In Radlands, there are no "lands", so every card has a function. Also, each card can be "junked" â€” you discard it for free to get a small effect of some sort. Also, each player has three camp cards in play at the start, which each have an ability. And if all that's not enough, you can pay to draw another card.

Access
Look at your game's components. Look across the board, and at all the cards, tokens, tiles, and chits. How much of it can I interact with, this turn? This is what I call access.

This window of choice should include much of the game.

Access gives the player a feeling of control. The absence of access gives a feeling of powerlessness, or, at best, makes people feel like they're building a ship in a bottle.

In Machi Koro, players buy cards from ten piles. I like the game, and have tried out a few different combinations of cards. However, this game has very minimal replayability, as these ten piles are always the same.

In the "Harbor" expansion, the game shuffles all the piles of cards, and many more, into a giant deck, from which ten random cards are displayed. This destroyed the access, as I could no longer buy the cards I wanted. I had to just buy from the ten random cards. Much of the long-term strategy went out of the game. 

In one of my prototypes, players could move one space per turn. However, this gave them only a few possible spaces they could go to. By simply allowing players to move up to two spaces per turn, they could reach far more spaces.

Race for the Galaxy is an excellent game. In the game, you draw lots of cards, but you also discard cards as the resource to pay for other cards. This lets you see many of the deck's cards, and the game has very high access for a card game.

If you're a beginner designer, worker placement is an excellent foundation for a game. (In a worker placement game, there's a board of spaces. On each player's turn, they put one of their workers on an unoccupied space, and do what it says. Typically, once players run out of workers, they're all returned, and a new round begins.)

Worker placement has very high access, as you can do almost anything you like. It also comes with a reasonable level of player interaction, as players can't take a space that another player has taken.
