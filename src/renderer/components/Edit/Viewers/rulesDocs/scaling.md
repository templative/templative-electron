Scaling
Scaling is the process by which you make your game work properly (and hopefully well), regardless of how many people are playing.

A map which is suited to five players, might be too big when the game is played with two. With more players, there might not be enough resources in play for everyone to get enough. In a cooperative game with more players, the game objective might be too easy.

Fixing the problems
It doesn't matter if the game plays differently at different player counts, as long as it's still good.

Doing nothing (or just a little bit) can be a very acceptable solution to scaling issues. The best scaling is no scaling at all. Some games can simply be played perfectly well with different player counts, with no special rules.

Boards
If your game has a board, a basic solution is two have a two-sided board â€” one for 2-3 players, and one for 4+ players.

You can also have your board be in pieces, and flip some of them, based on player count.

The boards in Caverna are cut up into slivers. You flip or remove some of them. There's a combination of board slivers for every player count from 2-7.

Cards
If your game has cards, having to fish through the game's decks, to remove all the cards for other player counts is onerous. If you have to alter the decks, just make it a very small number of impactful cards being added or removed.

As an alternative, you can simply add special text to cards, such that they do something extra or different, if you're in a game with a specific number of players. These are best in games that have "event cards", where a bit of extra text is okay, and the card affects everyone. These variable cards require extra words, but they don't require extra components, or that the players sift through the cards before each game.

Numerically scaling abilities
Overt scaling abilities that say something like "gain wood tokens equal to the number of players" can work, but are a bit "dirty laundry".

In my gangster game, players attack all their opponents simultaneously, by rolling custom dice. In a 5-player game, you have four other people attacking you, and this gets lethal too quickly. I made two faces of the red die a "grenade" ability. This ability causes opponents to lose 1 health if there are 4-5 players, 2 health if there are 3 players, and 3 health if there are 2 players. This was a very easy way to scale the game. The games with more players are still more lethal, but it's still reasonable.

Game length
The game length shouldn't necessarily be multiplied by having more players. Two hours is fine for a two-player game, but players will simply not play the game with five players if it's going to take five hours. You need to drastically cut back the game end condition, or number of rounds, even if it impacts the game.

If a game ends when its components run out, that can be a great way to scale the game length. Just use the same number of components, regardless of player count.
