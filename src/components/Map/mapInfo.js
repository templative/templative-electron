One set includes easy entry, smaller sized card games and party games that can be explained quickly and completed in around 20-30 minutes or less. The other is focused on gateway-plus games that offer slightly higher complexity and playtime of about 30-60 minutes. \n\nSome of their representative games include \"Ra,\" \"Green Team Wins,\" \"Gartenbau,\" \"Three Sisters,\" \"Kohaku,\" \"Blazon,\" \"Space Explorers,\" \"Resist,\" and \"Splito.\" They also plan to use crowdfunding for their projects.\n\nTo share your game with 25th Century Games, the preferred method is to send an email pitch or provide a personal introduction. You can find more details and submit your game idea through their website: [25th Century Games Submissions](https://www.25thcenturygames.com/game-design-submissions)."

        "interestedIn": "Tenets: Strategic depth & mechanical elegance. Player cognitive load should be spent on strategic decisions, not on understanding complex (sometimes fiddly) mechanics. While mechanical complexity can be appropriate \u2013 it must be applied to drive an exciting strategic payoff. In general we prefer to simplify games wherever possible. Organic start, organic progression, organic end. A progressive game play where pacing is driven by the players rather than strict mechanical progression and rounds. Reward over punishment. Reward players for good play, rather than punish them for mistakes. Resonant thematic drive. Strong and memorable thematic elements are relevant mechanically. We don't believe in stapling on themes, but strive to weave theme through game play. Ability to plan ahead. Decisions matter from turn to turn and players should have the ability to plan ahead. Of course, the best laid plans of squirrels and gamers\u2026 Balancing luck and skill. Our favorite games balance skill and luck. While tight strategic game play improves a player's chance of winning, elements of luck add drama, excitement, and an opportunity for players of all levels to enjoy a game together. We prefer randomness of inputs, rather than as a mechanic for resolution. Replay-ability. Replay-ability through both interesting, dynamic, game play, and through variable mechanics. No two games are alike. Tactile and visual. Board games are tactile and visual experiences. We value strong physical and visual design to engage players, draw them into the game, and improve ease of play. Screw the man, not the players. While we value player interaction and conflict in our designs, we also try to minimize feel bad and \u201cgotcha\u201d moments. We avoid mechanics that screw over individual players, create ganging up, or king-making dynamics. Bringing people together. Games are a conduit for bringing people together, both through exciting game play and community. Main course or dessert. Pine Island's initial focus is on medium weight games in the 30-60 minute range. These games can bring people together as events (a night of Nut Hunt), or be a side dish for a social gathering (a game after dinner). In the future we expect to expand our menu of games to include more \u201cmain dishes\u201d, or event games in the 60-120 minute range. Preferences: At Least 2-4 Players: Ideally any game we license will play at least 2-4 players. Our goal would be to expand the game to a single player mode, and potentially to higher player count if it made sense. Non-Cooperative: There are plenty of great co-op games out there, but for now, we aren't very interested in publishing either cooperative, or semi-cooperative games. Theme preferences: We don't have strong thematic preferences. We like cute animals, magic, farms, and pirates. We would steer away from certain themes, especially dark or edgy themes: Grimdark, Zombies, Horror, etc. Mechanism preferences: We aren't interested in social deduction mechanisms, bluffing, and kingmaking. We also aren't interested in roll & writes. No Party Games: We aren't interested in party games. Fun, thoughtful higher player count games could be a good fit for us, but we aren't interested in the Werewolfs or Cards Against Humanities. Deal breakers: Adult or explicit content Single player only Alternate rulesets for an existing game (or a 52 card deck of playing cards) A non-board game (TCG, toy, RPG, etc.) Offensive or insensitive cultural or social content",
